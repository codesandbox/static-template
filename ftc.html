    <h4>Season</h4>
    <p>Each FTC game season is classified into a season with each season's game being different than the previous year. Each season
      your team has a couple of months to build a robot (within compliance of the FTC rule book, updated every year) to complete certain tasks 
      during a tournament match. By completing certain tasks presented during a match, you will earn more points during a match (explained later).
      By earning points and wining a tournament match, you can advance your rank amongst 30-40 other teams at that tournament. Although, of course 
      it isn't all about the matches as judge presentations also play a huge factor in your final rank amongst the other teams. Judge presentations 
      are when you have to present your robot to the judges as well as anything else you did during the season to help you win certain awards. An
      example would be the stratasys award being the award given too the team who used the most 3D printed parts on their robot. In addition to 
      presenting a robot, you also have to present a engineering notebook that contains all the things that you did throughout the year. Ours includes
      daily entrys into the notebook, CAD models, our programs, etc.

    <h4>Gameplay</h4>
    <p>At a match you will be randomly paired up with another team attending the tournament which will be your allie for the match. You and your allie will be put 
      up against two other teams that you will compete against in order to score more points than them. Your allie for one match could be the opposing team another match.
      However, a match during a tournament consists of two parts each totaling up to 2 minutes and 30 seconds in time. Autonomous, which lasts 30 seconds and Tele-op,
      which lasts for the final 2 minutes of the match. Autonomous consist of your robot running pre-programmed instructions wihtout any added assistance from
      the two drivers. Once Autonomous is up, the two drivers transition into the Tele-op phase of the match. In the Tele-op phase of a match, the two drivers 
      are allowed to control the robot using console controllers in order to score points during a match.
