          <h1>Perfume poster</h1>
          <h2>
            This project was made for a homework. I had to imagine a perfume,
            make a new bottle and imagine an ad poster for it.
          </h2>
          <p>
            I adore Greek mythology, and art, as you probably could tell, and I
            thought right away of using the painting "The birth of Venus" by
            Boticelli as an inspiration. Going from there, I decided to name my
            perfume "Aphrodite", for the goddess of beauty. I then chose
            pictures of two differents bottles of parfume, one with a curvy
            body, to represent the curves of a woman, and for the lid, I chose
            one with a miror effect, as Aphrodite is associated with mirors.
            <br />
            <br />
            For the background, I obviously needed a beach, but I wanted one
            with sea foam, since it's associated to Aphrodite as well. I added
            more since there wasn't enough in my opinion. Then I added the
            scallop shell, some shadows, and there it was!
