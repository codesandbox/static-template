        <h1>Toddler Program (1-2 years old)</h1>
        <p>
          They’re on the move! We have a safe (and fun!) environment for
          toddlers to explore. Everything in our toddler classroom is designed
          for little explorers. That’s because a lot is going on at this age.
          When your child is wandering all over the place, that means they’re
          learning and discovering new things every day. At KinderCare, we put
          safety first to protect our families and staff. Visit our health and
          safety page to learn more.

        <h1>Preschool Program (3-4 years old)</h1>
        <p>
          Welcome to preschool, where we get them ready for what comes next …
          “big kid school!” This age is all about expression, when kids really
          start to form their own ideas about what they want to play and how
          they want to create. Every day in our preschool classroom, your child
          will explore science experiments, create artwork, and play pretend—all
          the skills needed for their big next step: kindergarten! At
          KinderCare, we put safety first to protect our families and staff.
          Visit our health and safety page to learn more.

        <p>
          It’s their senior year of preschool! We get them ready for the years
          ahead. When you walk into one of our pre-K classrooms, you’ll see
          artwork and writing displayed around the room. Labels are everywhere
          to help kids connect letters with words. You’ll also see pictures on
          the walls that reflect the families in our community. At KinderCare,
          we put safety first to protect our families and staff. Visit our
          health and safety page to learn more.
