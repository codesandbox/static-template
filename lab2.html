    <h1>Beauty of nature</h1>
    <p>
      Nature has given us so much that we cannot even imagine. Life on this
      earth is possible only because of nature. There are many other planets in
      the universe but without this nature life is not possible there. Thus
      nature is the basis of our life. Nature is not the same everywhere on
      earth. According to the place, nature changes its appearance and according
      to that place provides us with resources, as well as provides comfort to
      our mind, our eyes.

      Nature gives us so much, so it is our duty to respect it knowing its
      importance and not to destroy it for our selfishness. So that the children
      of man can also enjoy its beauty and take advantage of it, otherwise one
      day will be when people will be able to see and feel the beauty of this
      nature on the computer itself.
