    <h5>
        IT plays a big role in modern business, it helps companies improve business processes, achieve cost efficiencies, drive revenue & growth and maintain a competitive advantage in the marketplace. Here is a list of some of the areas of business in which IT is commonly made use of... </br>
    </br>
    </br>
        IT for Product Development: </br></br>
        Using IT can speed up the time it takes new products to reach the market. Companies can gather information and do market research on customers and competitors. Computer-assisted design (CAD) and manufacturing software can speed up prototyping and decision making, and collaboration software like slack allows teams to work on different parts of a project at the same time. 
    </br>
    </br>
    </br>
        IT connects stakeholders (like customers or shareholders): </br></br>
        Using global 24/7 interconnectivity, a customer service call originating in the USA, ends up in a call center in the Philippines, where a service agent could look up the relevant information on severs based in corporate headquarters based somewhere else like Germany. Public companies can use their websites to communicate with shareholders, research analysts or anyone else involved in their market.
    </br>
    </br>
    </br>
        In 'Process Improvement': </br></br>
        'Enterprise resource planning' (ERP) systems allow managers to review sales, costs and other metrics in one integrated piece of software. An ERP system may replace dozens of legacy systems for finance, human resources and other functional areas, therefore making a company's internal processes more efficient and cost-effective.
    </br>
    </br>
    </br>
        Cost Efficiencies: </br></br>
        IT implementation costs can be huge, however the long-term cost savings usually make it worth the investment. IT can often allow companies to reduce transaction or implementation costs. IT-based productivity software, like word processors or email clients, have allowed companies to save on the costs of photocopying and postage, while also improving product quality and customer service.
    </br>
    </br>
    </br>
        Globalization:  </br></br>
        IT is at the core of the models used for globalization, such as telecommuting and outsourcing. A company can outsource most of its non-core functions, like human resources and finances, to offshore companies and use network technologies to stay in contact with its overseas employees, customers and suppliers.</h5>
