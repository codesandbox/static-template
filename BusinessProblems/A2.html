    <h3>What causes digital projects to fail?</h3>

A large proportion of digital projects fail. The risk of failiure varies depending on the type of digital project and also what you define as failure.
</br> e.g. the website 'Couchbase' found that 90% of projects 'failed to deliver as promised, failed to deliver beyond minor improvements, or completely flopped.' (This is obviously a very broad definition of failure)
</br> Another site, CIO.com, reported that 50% of companies arenât successfully executing their digital strategies, and 20% believe that those very projects are a waste of time.
</br>
</br>
I have made a list below of some of the main reasons why a project can fail...
</br>
</br>
Collaboration: </br>
Successful digital projects require significant collaboration. Thatâs difficult and means that simple reasons for failure tend to stack up like building blocks. 
/br>
</br>
</br>
Poor vendor selection:</br>
</br>
Often the most common problem seen when it comes to failed digital projects is poor vendor selection.
</br>
A vendor can make or break a project in lots of ways, not just in their technical capability.
</br>
If youâre a comparatively small client, your work might get deprioritized. On the flip side, if youâre the single biggest thing a vendor has going on, they might struggle.
</br>
To avoid this a company can read reviews of the vendor, evaluate multiple options, and even ask for references from similar companies or projects that theyâve worked on before. 
</br>
</br>
</br>
Not accounting for other business processes: </br>
As an example... someone notices a problem/inefficiency in how a company is delivering its product to the customer. They decide to create a digital solution to address this. Then, they work to push that through, selling the project as the next step in customer-centricity. However, even if the solution does effectively solve the problem for the customer, it might not reflect or work well with the existing business process. The staff then ends up maintaining a tool that exists beyond their normal workflow, and the lacklustre internal support makes staff resentful and disengaged, further alienating an already-problematic tool.
</br>
After months of struggle, training, implementation, and service fees, the project is abandoned, written off due to âtough internal resistanceâ however in reality it was a failure of planning teams to fully account for existing business processes.
</br>
</br>
</br>
Investing in 'shiny objects' instead of customer value:</br>
Projects that fail are so often a result of investing in a cool gadget, not investing in business or customer value.
</br>
For instance, say a CEO asks a digital project manager to deploy a CRM. Perhaps The CEO just read an article that said CRMs are the future, and now they want one.
</br>
That is not a good digital project brief. Why? Because it didnât start with a business requirement or customer need. While a CRM might be a good idea, it certainly isnât a good idea just because the CEO suddenly decides it is.
</br>
The more resources a project takes up and the more time the project runs for, the more important it is to think about return on investment.
</br>
    Three things to keep in mind when deciding if a project is worthwhile:
</br>
1. Why youâre doing the project
</br>
2. What business problem it solves
</br>
3. What customer need it solves.
</br>
...The most successful projects will have all three. Most projects have number 2 or 3. Terrible projects often only have number 1, and the reason is usually something like âour CEO read an article.â
