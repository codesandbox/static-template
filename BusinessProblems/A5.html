When creating websites, Copyright and other intellectual property laws are important because they may restrict what you are able to publish. If you create websites for a living then copyright materials will be your stock-in-trade, so it is important to be familiar with these laws because dealing in copyright materials gives rise to legal risks.
</br></br>

The simplest way to get around copyright problems is, first, get permission from the original author, or second, if you want to publish information on your site from another site, link to it and perhaps get permission to publish an excerpt from the original site.
</br>
</br>
One thing that is important to know  is that Copyright law only protects "copyright works". For example, it protects the oil painting, operatic symphony and poetic epic with the same principles and rules as the doodle, the advertising ditty, or a slap-dash legal article.
</br>
</br>
Websites themselves are not a kind of copyright work, their constituent elements are likely to be protected by copyright. Website text and code may be protected as literary works; photographs and other website artworks may be protected as artistic works; website music tracks may be protected both as musical works and through sound recording copyright. A single video clip can accommodate a profusion of different rights.
</br>
</br> 
Another point to be aware of is that there is normally no copyright on an idea alone.
There can however be copyright on an idea that is central to a work which is itself protected by copyright law.
For example, copyright in a story could be infringed by a person copying the plot of that story, notwithstanding that the copyist takes care to avoid lifting a single phrase from the original story.
In our case it is important for us to note however that the ideas underlying a web design, no matter how specific, are probably of the wrong sort to attract the protection of the law of copyright.
