    <h3>How does GDPR impact digital projects?</h3>
</div>
</br>

<div class="content2">
    <h4>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a legal framework that sets guidelines for the collection and processing of personal information from individuals who live in the European Union (EU).
    </br>
    Since the Regulation applies regardless of where websites are based, it must be followed by all sites that attract European visitors, even if they don't specifically market goods or services to EU residents.
</br>
Digital projects will now need to take these new laws into account, if the project is customer-facing then they will need to ensure that customer information is not stored unnecessarily and not for periods of time exceeding what is layed out in the legislation.
