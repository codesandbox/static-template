This lab will cover the basic HTML concepts presented in the first chapters of your textbook.

For the labs this semester, you will be creating a website for a business website.

You will be responsible for designing the look of the page as we progress through the semester. As we learn more concepts, we will add additional pages and content to our site. For now, we'll start easy and make a basic page using notepad. Your first lab should include the following information:

A Word document that briefly outlines the purpose of your business.

In this document, discuss who the most likely customers are for your website and briefly discuss some of the things you think your customers might expect on the site. For example, you can discuss colors or content or something else that might appeal to your customers. You can look at similar webpages for inspiration.
