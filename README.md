## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

How to load and use custom fonts with CSS - ```<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Outfit"/>```

CSS Box Model -	Content - The content of the box, where text and images appear
			Padding - Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent
			Border - A border that goes around the padding and content
			Margin - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent

### Continued development

In the next project I want to focus on element alignment variations.

### Useful resources

- (https://css-tricks.com/centering-css-complete-guide/#aa-conclusion) - This helped me for ccentering in CSS. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- (https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_boxmodel.asp) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand CSS box model. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
