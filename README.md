Are you curious to know exactly how many years, months, days, hours, and minutes you've been alive? Look no further than the Year Calculator App! In this tutorial, we'll walk you through building a stylish and functional web application that calculates your age based on the birthdate you provide. Let's dive in!

## **HTML Structure**

We start by setting up the basic structure of our app using HTML. Save the following code in an `index.html` file:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
  <!-- Meta tags, title, and CSS link -->
</head>

<body>
  <main class="container" role="main">
    <div class="content">
      <!-- Input fields for day, month, and year -->
      <!-- Calculate button -->
      <!-- Display results -->
    </div>
  </main>
  <footer class="attribution" role="contentinfo">
    <!-- Attribution text -->
  </footer>
  <script src="./assets/js/main.js"></script>
</body>

</html>
```

## **Styling with CSS**

To make our app visually appealing, let's apply some CSS styles. Create a file named `style.css` and add the following code:

```css
/* Your CSS styles */
```

## **Adding Functionality with JavaScript**

Now, let's bring our app to life by adding JavaScript functionality. Create a file named `main.js` and insert the following code:

```javascript
// JavaScript functionality
```

## **Putting It All Together**

Replace the placeholders in the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files with the respective code snippets provided above.

With the HTML structure, CSS styles, and JavaScript functionality in place, you've successfully built a Year Calculator App! Your users can input their birthdate, and the app will calculate their age in years, months, days, hours, and minutes. This interactive and stylish app will surely impress your friends and family.

Feel free to customize the colors, fonts, and layout to match your personal style. You can even extend the functionality by adding more features like showing the age in weeks, displaying a countdown to the next birthday, or allowing users to calculate the age of historical figures. The possibilities are endless!
