# Broken Images Checker Bookmarklet

This bookmarklet is a JavaScript code snippet that you can save as a bookmark in your web browser. When you click on the bookmark, it will scan the current web page for broken images and display them in a popup container.

## How to Use

1. Create a new bookmark in your web browser.
2. Copy the entire JavaScript code from the `.min.js`
3. Apply it to the URL field.

## Current Bookmarklets

## Please note that these bookmarklets are primarily built for personal use to streamline development. Please use them at your discretion. I will continue to update this repository as time progresses.
