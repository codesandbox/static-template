### Planing

started off by creating a user story then a wireframe with ideas for the website. I then started by researching on streamin websites like Nertfix, YouTube, Amazon Prime Video to name a few. I started off with the trial and error stage to sind out whta best suits the clients requirement.

#### Unsolved Problems

The Star rating system only works by hovering over it with the cursor rather than being clickable. The recommendation button needs to shifted and adjusted properly

##### The Recommendation Special Feature

I solved this by creating a button on the recommendation page and linking it to the javascript. i then used Arrays(Movie Titles), QuearySelector and EventListener.

###### Describe how some of your favourite functions work

I created a fuction that will help generate a random movie for the users as a recommendation from the array.
