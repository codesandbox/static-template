      <h1>About us</h1>
      <p>
        Welcome to Little Stars. A school with a true heart and soul. Our
        programs incorporate dynamic classroom instruction with caring,
        qualified teachers and enriching indoor and outdoor play experiences. We
        know that these first experiences within a school setting will have a
        long lasting impact on children’s future learning. We embrace a
        philosophy of education that combines a nurturing, inclusive learning
        environment with an increasingly challenging academic program that
        addresses the developmental needs of each child. In addition to
        academics – social and emotional well-being also plays a significant
        role in a child’s development. Our curriculum, various activities, and
        daily experiences provide children with opportunities for a fun,
        enriching and exciting time while they make long lasting relationships.
        We create a positive environment which encourages children to explore
        their surroundings on a daily basis. Upon completion of our program, we
        believe that your child’s well-rounded experiences will provide them the
        necessary strengths for emotional, social, cognitive, gross/fine motor,
        and academic excellence.
      </p>
      <h1>A History of Excellence</h1>
      <p>
        For over 20 years Little Stars has started children off on a lifetime of
        learning in a nurturing educational environment where each child feels
        happy, respected, proud, secure and loved. Ours was the first school in
        Romania to attain elite accreditation by the National Association for
        the Education of Young Children (NAEYC). Since then we have maintained
        continuous accreditation by meeting all ten Early Childhood Program
        Standards – with over 400 individual criteria. This history has
        culminated in an organization that provides children and families the
        individual attention they need while providing world-class resources and
        an extensive scope of early childhood programs.
      </p>
      <h1>Diversity</h1>
      <p>
        Little Stars’s commitment to diversity is integral to the mission of the
        school. The different perspectives and experiences of our families
        define the fabric of our community. These many perspectives and
        experiences contribute to the growth of each child and help form their
        vision of the world. The vibrancy and vitality we feel at Turtle Rock
        comes from the people who are here. At its root are the varied interests
        and experiences, the different backgrounds, cultures, religions, views,
        and perspectives that our children, staff and families bring to the
        school. Each of us adds to the richness of another’s experience.
        Working, learning and playing together teaches us lifelong lessons about
        appreciating each other, about knowing and understanding each other,
        about learning from each other.
