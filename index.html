          <p>
            I currently work for a small and remote recruitment, AAI
            EmployAbility. I started as a humble Business Support Intern who was
            pushed towards Sales. I quickly learned that I was at my happiest
            and my authentic self when I was solving technical problems with the
            company's software. I love being presented with a problem, trying to
            fix it myself, then turning to my trusty friend, Google.
          </p>
          <p>
            I enjoy reading forum posts and help documents to do cool things
            with the technology at work. Fast forward to 2022, I am now the
            Operations Coordinator which is code for Technical Support / Process
            Improvement / GDPR Officer / CRM Manager / Website Person.
          </p>
          <p>
            Working in a small organisation is flexible, and can also be very
            demanding and provides little space to advance which led me to think
            seriously about what I want to do with my career...
