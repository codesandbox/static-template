      <h3>Gouda</h3>
      <br>
      <p>
        Gouda, named after the town in the Netherlands where it was traditionally traded, is one of the oldest recorded cheeses still made today, with its first mention in the late 12th Century. It's made from cow's milk in large rounds with a thin rind. Gouda has a light, mild flavor that varies slightly depending on how long it's aged--generally from four weeks to over a year. It can also be smoked during ageing. It's extremely versatile and one of the most popular cheeses world-wide.

        <h3>Honey Goat</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
          Honey goat cheese, as the name implies, is the combination of goat cheese, or chevre (from the French word for goat) and honey. High-end delis may sell this as a single offering or you can make it yourself at home by softening a log of chevre and blending in honey to taste. Careful not to add to much honey! The combination of tangy chevre and sweet honey tickles the tongue. Goat cheese itself has been made for thousands of years and comes in many forms. Honey goat is ideal for spreading on crackers, crostini, or on tortillas for veggie wraps.

          This devinely creamy cheese from Italy is made with cow's milk or buffalo mozzerella that is formed into a small ball while warm and then stuffed with cream and stringy mozzarella or stracciatella scraps.

      <p>
        It's no surprise that this hard cheese made from cow's milk hails from Ireland, although it's actually made in Cork, not Dublin. Invented in the 1990s, Dubliner is made in blocks or rectangular loaves and aged for 12 - 24 months. It has a sharp but sweet taste and a slightly crumbly texture. Use it anywhere you'd use cheddar but want more of a kick to the tastebuds.</p>

        <h2 id="cheeseboard-anchor">How to Make the Perfect Cheeseboard</h2>
        <p>
          The best cheeseboards feature more than just cheese and crakers. A good cheeseboard teases your palette, combining complementary flavors and textures to create a party in your mouth with every bite.</p>
         <p> The ideal cheese board has six elements: 
          <ul>
            <li> 3-4 distinct cheeses (e.g., hard/soft, sweet/sharp, cow/goat)
            <li> Crackers or crostini (avoid crackers like Ritz or Wheat Thins, which have a strong flavor profile)
            <li> Fruit, such as grapes, dates, or apricots
            <li> Something crunchy, like pistachios or cornichons
            <li> Something salty, like meat (salami slices and proscuito work particularly well) or green olives
            <li> A sweet spread, such as quince paste or blackberry jam
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>Experiment with various flavor profiles and texture combinations in each board, making cheese the star of the show. No matter what you choose, you and your guests are sure to come back for seconds and thirds, because who can resist cheese?</p>
