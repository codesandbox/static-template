      Hello, My name is Rachael DeBoer and I am a senior at Eastern Washington
      University. I am a Visual Communication Design major with minors in
      programming, web development, and a UX certificate. I have a passion for
      design. I truly believe in the power and effect design can have on the
      world. If used correctly, I belive design has the ability to make a
      positive impact on the world we all live in. I especially have an interest
      in illustration, graphics creation, and user experience design. I love
      creating my own original art, graphics, logos, stickers, and so much more.
      I enjoy the creative freedom that comes with image creation. User
      experience design has a similar appeal. It combines my knowledge and love
      for programming and my passion for design. I can truly learn what it means
      to connect with a user and reach people through my work.
