                covering your chest and your shoulder blades. The tape should be
                completely level. As you breathe normally, have a friend insert
                a finger between your chest and the measuring tape. This suit
                measurement yields both your chest and suit size.

                measurement determines the ideal length from the bottom of the
                collar to the bottom of the jacket. Measure from where your neck
