        <h2>Vision</h2>
        <p>
          The Department of Electronics and Computer Engineering offers
          Electronics Engineering (ECE) and Computer Engineering (CpE) programs.
          The department envisions the ECE and CpE graduates as competent and
          ethical professionals in the area they have chosen. For the ECE, the
          areas are in Electronics, Communications, and Digital Signal
          Processing. For the CpE, the areas are in Embedded Systems, Computer
          Hardware Architecture, Computer Networks, Multimedia Systems and
          Machine Learning.

        <h2>Program History</h2>
        <p>
          The Department of Electronics and Computer Engineering (DECE) is one
          of the largest departments in the Gokongwei College of Engineering at
          De La Salle University. Currently, the department has twenty-six
          academic personnel, one non-academic personnel, and eight support
          personnel providing technical, professional and administrative
          services. Different laboratories have been established for each area
          of specialization. A number of specialized modern research equipment
          was acquired from the Department of Science and Technology through the
          Engineering and Science Education Program. The equipment is used by
          the personnel and students for research and development.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Research Center of the Department will also provide consultancy
          services to industry, it also conducts industrially relevant research.
          During the starting phase, the Center will identify research areas
          which have elements of research, service, and development. The results
          from the research in an identified area should be available as a
          service to our local industry. Aside from undertaking collaborative
          research projects with industry, the Research Center of the ECE
          department also aims to train industry-oriented researchers and
          engineers through seminars or short course training.
