    <strong> Re: Eileen Dover university application </strong><br />
    <br />

    Dear Eileen, Thank you for your recent application to join us at the
    University of Awesome's science faculty to study as part of your PhD next
    year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.
    Starting dates We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us
    at any time, however it would suit us better if you could start at the
    beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows: First
    semester: 9 September 2016 Second semester: 15 January 2017 Third semester:
    2 May 2017 Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you
    would prefer. You can find more information about important university dates
    on our website. Subjects of study At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a
    pretty open-minded research facility — as long as the subjects fall
    somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an
    intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just the kind of person we'd like to
    have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most
    intrigued by are as follows, in order of priority: Turning H2O into wine,
    and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C14H12O3.) Measuring the effect on
    performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30°C (86°F), when
    the audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 × 103 increasing to 3
    × 104.) HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores. So please
    can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how
    long you'd expect the research to take, required staff and other resources,
    and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks. Exotic dance moves
    Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I did study exotic
    tribal dances. To answer your question, my favourite dances are as follows,
    with definitions: Polynesian chicken dance A little known but very
    influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village would dance
    around in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be
    "fruitful". Icelandic brownian shuffle Before the Icelanders developed fire
    as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which involved
    huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies
    around in imperceptibly tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow
    students used to say that he thought this dance inspired modern styles such
    as Twerking. Arctic robot dance An interesting example of historic
    misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believed to have discovered a
    new dance style characterized by "robotic", stilted movements, being
    practiced by inhabitants of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it
    was discovered that they were just moving like this because they were really
    cold. For more of my research, see my exotic dance research page. Yours
    sincerely, Dr Eleanor Gaye University of Awesome motto: "Be awesome to each
