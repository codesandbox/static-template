            <h2>What is PHP?</h2>
            <p>
              PHP (recursive acronym for PHP:
              <code>Hypertext Preprocessor</code> ) is a widely-used open source
              general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited for
              web development and can be embedded into HTML.
            </p>
            <p>Nice, but what does that mean? An example:</p>
            <h3>Example #1 An introductory example</h3>

              </code>
            </div>
            <p>
              Instead of lots of commands to output HTML (as seen in C or Perl),
              PHP pages contain HTML with embedded code that does "something"
              (in this case, output "Hi, I'm a PHP script!"). The PHP code is
              enclosed in special start and end processing instructions
              <?php and ?>
              that allow you to jump into and out of "PHP mode."
            </p>
            <p>
              What distinguishes PHP from something like client-side JavaScript
              is that the code is executed on the server, generating HTML which
              is then sent to the client. The client would receive the results
              of running that script, but would not know what the underlying
              code was. You can even configure your web server to process all
              your HTML files with PHP, and then there's really no way that
              users can tell what you have up your sleeve.
            </p>
            <p>
              The best part about using PHP is that it is extremely simple for a
              newcomer, but offers many advanced features for a professional
              programmer. Don't be afraid to read the long list of PHP's
              features. You can jump in, in a short time, and start writing
              simple scripts in a few hours.
            </p>
            <p>
              Although PHP's development is focused on server-side scripting,
              you can do much more with it. Read on, and see more in the What
              can PHP do? section, or go right to the introductory tutorial if
              you are only interested in web programming.

            <h2>What can PHP do?</h2>
            <p>
              Anything. PHP is mainly focused on server-side scripting, so you
              can do anything any other CGI program can do, such as collect form
              data, generate dynamic page content, or send and receive cookies.
              But PHP can do much more.
            </p>
            <p>There are three main areas where PHP scripts are used.</p>
            <ul class="ul-list">
              <li>Server-side scripting.</li>
              <li>Command line scripting.</li>

          In order to develop and run PHP Web pages, three vital components need
          to be installed on your computer system.
        </p>
        <ul class="ul-list">
          <li>
            <span>Web Server</span> - PHP will work with virtually all Web
            Server software, including Microsoft's Internet Information Server
            (IIS) but then most often used is freely available Apache Server.
            Download Apache for free here: http://httpd.apache.org/download.cg
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>Database</span> - PHP will work with virtually all database
            software, including Oracle and Sybase but most commonly used is
            freely available MySQL database. Download MySQL for free here:
            http://www.mysql.com/downloads/index.html

          <li>
            <span>PHP Parser</span> - In order to process PHP script
            instructions, a parser must be installed to generate HTML output
            that can be sent to the Web Browser. This tutorial will guide you
            how to install PHP parser on your computer.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Variable_Types">
        <header class="headers">Variable Types</header>
        <p>
          The main way to store information in the middle of a PHP program is by
          using a variable. Here are the most important things to know about
          variables in PHP.
        </p>

        <ul class="ul-list">
          <li>
            All variables in PHP are denoted with a leading dollar sign ($).
          </li>
          <li>
            The value of a variable is the value of its most recent assignment.
          </li>
          <li>
            Variables are assigned with the = operator, with the variable on the
            left-hand side and the expression to be evaluated on the right.
          </li>
          <li>
            Variables can, but do not need, to be declared before assignment.
          </li>
          <li>
            Variables in PHP do not have intrinsic types - a variable does not
            know in advance whether it will be used to store a number or a
            string of characters.
          </li>
          <li>Variables used before they are assigned have default values.</li>
          <li>
            PHP does a good job of automatically converting types from one to
            another when necessary.
          </li>
          <li>PHP variables are Perl-like.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          PHP has a total of eight data types which we use to construct our
          variables:
        </p>
        <ul class="ul-list">
          <li>
            <span>Integers:</span> are whole numbers, without a decimal point,
            like 4195.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>Doubles:</span> are floating-point numbers, like 3.14159 or
            49.1.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>Booleans:</span> have only two possible values either true or
            false.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>NULL:</span> is a special type that only has one value: NULL.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>Strings:</span> are sequences of characters, like 'PHP
            supports string operations.'
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>Arrays:</span> are named and indexed collections of other
            values.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>Objects:</span> are instances of programmer-defined classes,
            which can package up both other kinds of values and functions that
            are specific to the class.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>Resources:</span> are special variables that hold references
            to resources external to PHP (such as database connections).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The first five are simple types, and the next two (arrays and objects)
          are compound - the compound types can package up other arbitrary
          values of arbitrary type, whereas the simple types cannot.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will explain only simile data type in this chapters. Array and
          Objects will be explained separately.
        </p>

        <h2>Integers</h2>
        <hr />
        <p>
          They are whole numbers, without a decimal point, like 4195. They are
          the simplest type .they correspond to simple whole numbers, both
          positive and negative. Integers can be assigned to variables, or they
          can be used in expressions, like so:
        </p>
        <div class="code">
          <code>
            $int_var = 12345;
            <br />
            $another_int = -12345 + 12345;
          </code>
        </div>
        <p>
          Integer can be in decimal (base 10), octal (base 8), and hexadecimal
          (base 16) format. Decimal format is the default, octal integers are
          specified with a leading 0, and hexadecimals have a leading 0x.
        </p>
        <p>
          For most common platforms, the largest integer is (2**31 . 1) (or
          2,147,483,647), and the smallest (most negative) integer is . (2**31 .
          1) (or .2,147,483,647).
        </p>
        <h2>Doubles</h2>
        <hr />
        <p>
          They like 3.14159 or 49.1. By default, doubles print with the minimum
          number of decimal places needed. For example, the code:
        </p>
        <div class="code">
          <code>
            $many = 2.2888800;
            <br />
            $many_2 = 2.2111200;
            <br />
            $few = $many + $many_2;
            <br />
            print(.$many + $many_2 = $few&lt;br>.);
          </code>
        </div>
        <p>It produces the following browser output:</p>
        <div class="code">
          <code>
            2.28888 + 2.21112 = 4.5
          </code>
        </div>
        <h2>Boolean</h2>
        <hr />
        <p>
          They have only two possible values either true or false. PHP provides
          a couple of constants especially for use as Booleans: TRUE and FALSE,
          which can be used like so:
        </p>
        <div class="code">
          <code>
            if (TRUE)<br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print("This will always print&lt;br>");<br />
            else <br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;print("This will never print&lt;br>");
          </code>
        </div>
        <h2>NULL</h2>
        <hr />
        <p>
          NULL is a special type that only has one value: NULL. To give a
          variable the NULL value, simply assign it like this:
        </p>
        <div class="code">
          <code>
            $my_var = NULL;
          </code>
        </div>
        <p>
          The special constant NULL is capitalized by convention, but actually
          it is case insensitive; you could just as well have typed:
        </p>
        <div class="code">
          <code>
            $my_var = null;
          </code>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Decision_Making">
        <header class="headers">Decision Making</header>
        <p>
          The if, elseif ...else and switch statements are used to take decision
          based on the different condition.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can use conditional statements in your code to make your
          decisions. PHP supports following three decision making statements −
        </p>
        <ul class="ul-list">
          <li>
            <span>if...else statement</span> − use this statement if you want to
            execute a set of code when a condition is true and another if the
            condition is not true
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>elseif statement</span> − is used with the if...else statement
            to execute a set of code if one of the several condition is true
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>switch statement</span> − is used if you want to select one of
            many blocks of code to be executed, use the Switch statement. The
            switch statement is used to avoid long blocks of if..elseif..else
            code.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Loop_Types">
        <header class="headers">Loop Types</header>
        <p>
          Loops in PHP are used to execute the same block of code a specified
          number of times. PHP supports following four loop types.
        </p>
        <ul class="ul-list">
          <li>
            <span>for</span> − loops through a block of code a specified number
            of times.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>while</span> − loops through a block of code if and as long as
            a specified condition is true.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>do...while</span> − loops through a block of code once, and
            then repeats the loop as long as a special condition is true.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>foreach</span> − loops through a block of code for each
            element in an array.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Arrays">
        <header class="headers">Arrays</header>
        <p>
          An array is a data structure that stores one or more similar type of
          values in a single value. For example if you want to store 100 numbers
          then instead of defining 100 variables its easy to define an array of
          100 length.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are three different kind of arrays and each array value is
          accessed using an ID c which is called array index.
        </p>
        <ul class="ul-list">
          <li>
            <span>Numeric array</span> − An array with a numeric index. Values
            are stored and accessed in linear fashion.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>Associative array</span> − An array with strings as index.
            This stores element values in association with key values rather
            than in a strict linear index order.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>Multidimensional array</span> − An array containing one or
            more arrays and values are accessed using multiple indices
          </li>
