      I started Boolean with barely any knowledge of how web development worked.
      The lerning method created by these guys is great, online class in the
      morning and increasingly difficult exercise in the afternoon. Learn by
      doing is absolutely a proper description for this course. Teachers are
      really helpful and costantly available for every kind of queries and
      feedbacks! If you want to improve your professional skills in web
      development world, this is definitely what you need.

      I already had some experience in web development, tried several free
      courses and certifications, even put a commercial website online. But I
      always felt like something was missing, in the way I approached coding.
      The amazing instructors at Boolean carreers helped me in acquiring solid
      foundations and methodologies to approach any software-related problem,
      and to learn new technologies as needed. Further, they helped me find a
      job by helping me every step of the way, from talking to recruiters to
      discussing salaries. It is not an easy road, especially for a beginner,
      but, in my opinion, it's well worth it.

      "The code camp that changed my life" I wanted to become a developer but I
      didn't know where to begin. I had a career in basketball, and a high
      school degree. Coding wasn't something I seriously did before, but after
      the course, I got all the means necessary to enter the market and
      understand it. Now I have a job, and I can develop my own projects in the
      meantime. All my gratitude goes to Boolean Careers. The teachers helped me
      build my approach to coding, while answering all my questions and doubts I
      had about the tech world and the career I was pursuing. They helped me
      build my CV and gave me killer advices to showcase my skills: I landed a
      job even before the end of the camp! I highly recommend this course.

      "Boolean Careers is a doozy!!!" Boolean Careers is the coolest thing I've
      ever done. During these 6 months we've dealt with many different topics
      about programming that allowed me to broaden my mind to a new possible and
      beautiful life. Boolean methods are cutting-edge: you can attend lessons
      at home; do homeworks helped by tutors and discuss with collegues about
      lessons topics. Boolean really changed positevely my life , in a way I
      never imagined!!

      "What a deal!" No one deal was so convenient as learning how to develop in
      a professional way. The skills you reach make you able to work, right at
      the end of Boolean master, in a structurated company or to make your own
      business if you already have your idea. Good Job Boolean!
