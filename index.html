    <h1>Fundamentals of Martial Arts</h1>
    <p>
      It is a martial art invented by
      <span class="highlighted-text"> many cultures </span> to defend themselves from
      other violences. It was design to look like a dance to trick the guards.
      They perform kicks, ground movements, and punches. Martial arts were
      supposed to be used for self defense but, people take advange of that
      knowlege.

    <h1 id="headline">Capoeria</h1>
    <p>
      Capoeria is martial art that requires your arms, hands, and feet to
      attack, avoid, or even defend aganist other opponents. People in bravil design the martial art to look like a dance. I have three years of experience in practing Capoeria. It is so cool because not everyone do martial arts at the same time. 3 people can play music on a berimbau and drums.
