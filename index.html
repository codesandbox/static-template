      In his sixties now and yet Delaney found his heart still mocked him. His
      dream of Maeve — the man she was with so tall Delaney had woken with his
      neck sore from looking up at him — fretted the morning so that he burnt

      dreamed about muesli instead of the fry he’d promised her the night
      before. | © Clive Collins
