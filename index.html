          It's important to find your playstyle first in order to find what type
          of squad would best suit you
        </p>
        <p>
          Finding your playstyle is easy. First think about what type of player
          you are. Do you like to be more agressive or more passive, do you like
          long range or short range.
        </p>
        <p class="highlight">
          Once you figure this out you can then search for players to add to
          your squad or you can look for an already built squad to join.
