<p> The Blackjack game that I turned in for my bootcamp course was Frankensteined together to meet a deadline and
   when I came back to the code after graduation, it was nearly unreadable, even to me.
  To build a better understanding of MVC architecture and coding best practices, I decided to 
  build a series of smaller games, each reinforcing just a small piece of the logic needed to build a
   fully-functioning Blackjack game.   </p>
   <p> Part 1 is played with only 10 'cards', each with a respective point value from 1-10. Focus is on:
     <ul><li>shuffling the 'deck' using Math.random and a while loop</li><li>Calculating player scores using a for loop</li>
      <li>Displaying cards and player scores using DOM manipulation</li></p></ul>
<p>My code here could definitely use some tightening up - the JS is 161 lines and it feels like half of that is just toggling button visibility!
However, since I was able to implement all the game logic and DOM manipulation from scratch, I consider this part of the project a success.
