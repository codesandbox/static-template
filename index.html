      About Me.
    </h2>
    <p>
      professional and educational background includes positions as interpreter
      combined with a bachelor's degree and professional experience in an
      administrative field working as a finance officer. I am calm, open-minded,
      curious and a good listener and it will be natural for me to be in
      communication with both IRC staff and beneficiaries. When I communicate
      with others, I strive to create mutual understanding in order to create
      trust.
