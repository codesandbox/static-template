    <h2> About Me </h2>
    <h3> I am very interested in STEAM and advancing my skills in all areas that fall under this umbrella. This encouraged me to particpate in an introductory coding class that will further help me to expand my experience, and I hope to take what I learn from this class to future programming opportunities and esentially hope to broaden my familiarity within this field.
