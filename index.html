    <h1>Nigeria</h1>
    <p>
      The Federal Republic of Nigeria, commonly referred to as Nigeria, is a
      federal republic in West Africa, bordering Niger in the north, Chad in the
      northeast, Cameroon in the southeast, and Benin in the west. Its coast in
      the south is located on the Gulf of Guinea in the Atlantic Ocean. The
      federation comprises 36 states and 1 Federal Capital Territory, where the
      capital, Abuja is located. Nigeria is officially a democratic secular
      country.

      Nigeria has been home to a number of ancient and indigenous kingdoms and
      states over the millennia. The modern state originated from British
      colonial rule beginning in the 19th century, and took its present
      territorial shape with the merging of the Southern Nigeria Protectorate
      and Northern Nigeria Protectorate in 1914. The British set up
      administrative and legal structures while practising indirect rule through
      traditional chiefdoms. Nigeria became a formally independent federation in
      1960. It experienced a civil war from 1967 to 1970. It thereafter
      alternated between democratically elected civilian governments and
      military dictatorships until it achieved a stable democracy in 1999, with
      the 2011 presidential election considered the first to be reasonably free
      and fair.
