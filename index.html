            <h2>Breaking the Myths around Cybersecurity</h2>
            <p><span>Edyoda</span>&nbsp;| 31 Mar 2023</p>
            <p>
              As the dependency on online platforms is increasing daily,
              cybersecurity is becoming an important concern for all companies
              today. The number of cyberattacks is ever-rising even after
              adopting every security measure possible by businesses. Cyber
              attackers are developing advancing technologies that are
              continuing to cause more damage. There are many methods through
              which a cyber attack is committed like software vulnerabilities,
              user interaction (using malicious links, email attachments) and
              use of stolen credentials logins, encryption keys.

            <h2>Challenges of Machine Learning in Big Data Analytics</h2>
            <p><span>Edyoda</span>&nbsp;| 31 Mar 2023</p>
            <p>
              Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence which is
              an important part of computer science. The revolution of Big Data
              promises to transform the way we work, live and think by enabling
              the process of optimization, discovering insights and improved
              decision making. This potential relies on the ability to extract
              value from big data and provide data analytics. Machine learning
              is the ability to learn from data, provide insights, predictions,
              suggestions from data which help in the decision-making process.

              A business must always introspect the areas where they lack in

              One of the main precautions or a contingency plan that is
              necessary for every business and especially industries working
              with clouds, networks and computers should conduct a backup of its
              files which will serve as a boon in any point of time.

            <h2>Impact of Cloud Computing in various industries</h2>
            <p><span>Edyoda</span>&nbsp;| 31 Mar 2023</p>
            <p>
              Cloud computing has been rapidly gaining pace in the world of
              information technology. It has been observed that over 90% of
              global enterprises are using cloud technology as part of their
              business. Every industry has its own technology dynamics designed
              to suit its infrastructure. To understand the future of cloud
              computing, one needs to understand the dynamics of cloud computing
              in various key industries. According to the reports by Dell
              companies that invest in Big Data, cloud, mobility and security
              enjoy up to 53% faster revenue growth than their competitors. As
              it is becoming more and more difficult to keep all the
              information, programs, and systems up and running on in-house
              computer servers, it has become necessary to store data on the
              cloud.

            <h2>What is Web Scraping?</h2>
            <p><span>Edyoda</span>&nbsp;| 31 Mar 2023</p>
            <p>
              Simply put, web scraping is one of the tools developers use to
              gather and analyze information from the Internet.Some websites and
              platforms offer application programming interfaces (APIs) which we
              can use to access information in a structured way, but others
              might not. While APIs are certainly becoming the standard way of
              interacting with today’s popular platforms, we don’t always have
              this luxury when interacting with most of the websites on the
              internet.

            <p>
              Machine learning is a field of artificial intelligence that uses
              statistical techniques to give computer systems the ability to
              “learn” (e.g., progressively improve performance on a specific
              task) from data, without being explicitly programmed. Think of how
              efficiently (or not) Gmail detects spam emails, or how good
              text-to-speech has become with the rise of Siri, Alexa, and Google

            <h2>Introduction To A Machine Learning Online Course</h2>
            <p><span>Edyoda</span>&nbsp;| 31 Mar 2023</p>
            <p>
              We have had an insight into Artificial Intelligence. Well, one of
              its subfields is machine learning and this introduction will help
              you get a fair idea of what a machine learning online course
              holds. To begin with, one must understand what machine learning
              is. Basically, it is a concept wherein a machine attempts to
              understand the structure of a data and fits that into models that
              people can understand and utilize. While traditional forms of
              computing were all about solving problems using set instructions
              and data, machine learning is all about computers utilizing data,
              training on it and using statistical data to output values. Thus,
              in this way, the process of decision-making is automated for
              computers based on sample input data. Now that we know what
              Machine Learning is all about, it’s time to delve in a little
              deeper.

            <h2>What is Income Share Agreement?</h2>
            <p><span>Edyoda</span>&nbsp;| 31 Mar 2023</p>
            <p>
              The term Income Share Agreement has been around for a long time
              since 1955 to be precise. Surprised, eh? It was first introduced
              by Milton Friedman, an American economist, and statistician who
              strongly believed in “free-market capitalism”. In the last few
              months, there has been a lot of buzz around it, particularly among
              college graduates.
