        <h1>The Unanswered Question</h1>
        <p>
          One day a young man stops by a florist after work. His good friend was
          sick and in hospital, so the young man planned on picking up some
          flowers on his way to visit her in the afternoon. He works as a
          labourer at a construction site so he starts work very early in the
          morning and finishes in the afternoon. Even though the young man grew
          up in a poor family and has been down on luck for most of his life, he
          was a very thoughtful young man, just like his mother taught him to
          be.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since he was little, the young man had always been working to help
          support his family. This is why he never finished school, and
          therefore had no qualifications to get an office job in the city. If
          the labour work at the construction site was unpleasant, he didn’t
          complain because it put food on the table and paid the bills. However,
          deep down inside he aspired to be an artist just like his mother, who
          unfortunately passed away when he was very young. While he lived a
          simple life as a labourer and didn&#39;t know very much about art, the
          young man was optimistic that with enough hard work, one day he will
          be able to study art and become an artist.
        </p>
        <p>
          As he stood outside the florist peering into the big glass window, the
          young man was filled with wonder by all the colourful flowers neatly
          placed around the shop. After a few minutes of looking around and
          composing himself again, he took a deep breath and stepped inside.
          Never having set foot in a florist before, the young man was a bit
          unsure about what to do next. He was also worried about all the dust
          and dirt on his clothes from working on the construction site all day,
          which he tried to clean off as best as he could before setting foot in
          the shop. But all that changed once the florist who stood near the
          counter gave him a beautiful bright smile, and beckoned him to come
          into the store with a gentle motion of her hand.
        </p>
        <p>
          “I didn’t realize that there would be so many flowers here! What
          should I buy for my sick friend in hospital?” he asked the friendly
          florist, a young woman about the same age as the friend he is
          visiting. He remembered hearing people say that every flower has its
          own meaning, but he wasn&#39;t sure what would be suitable for the
          occasion. Yet as soon as he asked the question, a wave of regret swept
          over him - he realised that he didn&#39;t have a lot of money to spend
          on the flowers, and was embarrassed that the florist might end up
          suggesting something that was too expensive for him.
        </p>
        <p>
          “What do you think about these Oriental Lilies?” the florist pointed
          to the star-shaped white and pink flowers near her feet. She explained
          that the flowers represent the &quot;universal symbol of beauty,&quot;
          which means that it is a safe choice for any kind of occasion. She
          thought to herself, with a quiet smile, that the flower symbolized the
          purity of heart, sweetness and virtue that seemed to match the young
          man perfectly, but she kept this information to herself.

        <aside class="discussion">

              the florist. And sometimes first impressions that you can have
              about someone aren&#39;t always accurate. Perhaps the florist
              wanted to wait and see what else the young man had to say before
              making her judgement about his character.</q

        </aside>
        <p>
          “They look wonderful, and smell lovely too!” It just occurred to the
          young man that beauty does come in many different forms - whether it
          is by sight, smell or touch. These were thoughts that never occurred
          to him on the construction site with all the choking dust, deafening
          noise and rough looking workmen going about their work. The smile on
          the corner of her mouth, as the florist explained the flowers to him,
          was intoxicating like the fragrance of the Oriental Lilies. You could
          just tell that she loved flowers and that they were precious to her by
          the way she talks about and handles them.

              environment and other living things in a similar way that animals
              do. The florist understands this and treats the flowers with a lot
              of care and respect, just as she would with other people and
              animals as well.</q

          Judging by the calloused hands fidgeting on torn sleeves of his dusty
          work shirt and also the feet in those hole-filled shoes that were
          constantly shuffling around, the florist could guess that the young
          man was worried about the cost of the purchase. As if to reassure the
          young man, she told him how she is also working hard to save some
          money up at the moment.
        </p>
        <p>
          “And the best thing is that the Oriental Lily isn’t an expensive
          flower,” she said, “otherwise, I couldn’t afford to buy one for myself
          once every month.”

              You could probably buy a bouquet of 20-30 roses for the price of
              10-15 stems of Oriental Lilies (depending on the variety, but
              maybe the prices in Japan are different to other countries). And
              since you only need to buy three or four to fit into a small vase
              next to a bed in hospital it should be something that the young
              man can afford.</q

          She then added: “I like making sketches and watercolour paintings of
          them when I have some spare time.” He learnt that the florist was
          going to art classes and studying to be an artist, which made the
          young man quite excited, although he was too embarrassed to tell her
          that he wanted to be an artist too. But he realises that the florist
          didn&#39;t let her circumstances get in the way of her dreams, so he
          was even more determined to pursue his goal.
        </p>
        <p>
          “My name is Rose,” the florist said after he bought the flowers, “I
          hope your friend makes a speedy recovery.” The sound of her words were
          being replayed in his mind long after he left the store, as did the
          image of her smile.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since that brief encounter, the young man’s heart began to grow fond
          of Rose, who he thought had the most beautiful smile and kind heart.
          You see, this was a feeling that he had not experienced in his life
          since his mother passed away. His father had left him soon after his
          mother passed away, so his grandmother raised him as a young child.
          However, as he was too shy and couldn&#39;t find another reason to
          stop by the florist again, he would simply wave at her from afar when
          he passed by on the way to and from work.

              someone) and the other is &quot;一目惚れ&quot; (love at first
              sight). The young man didn&#39;t immediately fall in love with the
              florist when he set eyes on her, but as he got to know her better
              and thought about his feelings more, he developed stronger
              feelings for her. From that first meeting, he only had a feeling
              that he might fall in love with the florist, which is why he
              didn&#39;t say anything to her.</q

          As much as he wanted to tell Rose about the feelings he had inside, he
          could see all the rich and well-dressed men that stop at the shop to
          talk to the florist. Some of the men even offered to buy her flowers -
          the more extravagantly they dressed, the more expensive flowers they
          wanted to buy for her. However, he knew that her favourite flower was
          the one that they would never care to look at. And so he would wave to
          Rose and stop just long enough to see her smile and wave back and him
          then continue on his way.

          As he was rummaging through some old books on the shelf, an old
          manuscript that was wedged between a couple of heavy tomes fell out
          onto the floor with a puff of dust. The young man picked the
          manuscript up off the floor, dusted off the cover of the book and read

            <h2>From rose petals to origami flowers</h2>
            <h3>Preface</h3>
            <p>
              By its very definition, origami is the folding of paper into a
              shape or form, and paper is of course made from plant materials.
              This can also include various types of flowers and its petals,
              which already possess natural colours and patterns that are more
              beautiful than what we are able to reproduce on paper. So while it
              might not seem like an obvious starting material, for a discerning
              origamist it may very well be the most logical choice.
            </p>
            <p>
              The idea of making origami flowers from flower petals may sound
              like an exercise in futility and frustration, since turning a
              flower from its natural form to an origami model is a demanding
              task that doesn’t necessarily increase its aesthetic appeal. Yet
              like many artisans who choose to hone their skills on a seemingly
              impossible task, the purpose for undertaking the task isn’t simply
              about being able to complete it.
            </p>
            <p>
              Previous enquiries made to verify if others had attempted or
              achieved this feat failed to turn up any substantial information
              or leads. However, one cannot dismiss the notion that there are
              others who have also successfully tackled this exercise, even if
              there are no florists or origamists that have come forward to
              verify their attempts. The information documented below is a brief
              description of how to use flower petals for origami, which
              acknowledges the fact that not every flower is going to be
              suitable for a particular type of origami model, and that success
              is never a guarantee when working with such delicate and organic
              raw materials. However, what is certain is that you will gain a
              much greater appreciation for both flora and origami in the
              process.
            </p>
            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>
              Preparing a flower petal into a material suitable for origami
              essentially involves the removal of existing moisture so that it
              can hold its shape when creased. This also requires you to press
              the flower petal so it becomes more pliable but retains enough
              moisture so that it is not too brittle when folded. Therefore the
              origami model you decide to make determines the type of flower
              used, and the preparation required (and vice versa). Due to the
              various factors that impact the drying process of flower petals
              (e.g. temperature, humidity, size of petals, etc.) the exact
              timing is difficult to estimate precisely without a controlled
              environment. In addition, this is a summary of the general process
              for a rose petal but different types of flower will require
              adjustments to the factors and variables that will be described in
              more detail.
            </p>
            <h3>Selecting the flower</h3>
            <p>
              The primary considerations in selecting the types of flowers to
              use for origami are based on the physical characteristics of the
              flowers, as determined by the size, shape and thickness of the
              flowers. Since larger flowers tend to also have a thicker and a
              more fibrous composition (as well as more prominent veins running
              through the petal), they become more brittle and hence more
              difficult to fold when pressed and dried. Interestingly enough,
              rose petals seem to have an optimal size and thickness when it
              comes to making miniature origami cranes, as do certain types of
              orchids. Pick petals that are larger and have less curvature as it
              will reduce the available surface for folding and minimize the
              distortion of its shape when pressed into a flat sheet.
            </p>
            <h3>Drying the petals</h3>
            <p>
              Make sure that all moisture from the surface of the petals is
              removed by air drying them first. You can use a tissue or a cloth
              to absorb excessive dew or moisture from the petals before air
              drying. It is advisable to press dry the flowers using paper that
              is thick and absorbent (such as blotting paper) and to place some
              weight on top to help the petals retain a flat and smooth surface.
              You may also need to change the paper because the moisture
              retained in the paper used to press the petals can cause
              discolouration of the petals as part of its natural decomposition
              process.
            </p>
            <p>
              Even if the flower petals are already quite flat you should still
              press them, because in the process of drying they can sometimes
              lose their original shape/form. A slow and gradual dehydration
              process, which can be obtained using devices such as dehumidifiers
              or materials like desiccants is also possible but may require a
              more specialized set up.
            </p>
            <h3>Examining/testing the petals</h3>
            <p>
              Due to the different size of flower petals and the temperature or
              humidity of the surrounding, you may need to regularly check the
              progress of drying over a number of weeks. The most reliable way
              for determining when the petals are dry enough is to take a small
              sample from the same batch of flower petals you are drying and try
              to make a crease. If the crease does not hold its shape or it
              feels very soft in the fingertips then it is probably still too
              moist. On the other hand, if folding the petal causes it to tear
              apart then it is too dry. Another way to tell if the flower petal
              is suitable for folding is to see if you can leave fingerprints on
              the petals when you press your finger onto the surface. When there
              is a small trace of moisture and pliability, It should leave a
              very faint impression of your fingerprint, but if it is very
              smooth and glossy it indicates that the petal is likely to be too
              fragile and brittle.
            </p>
            <h3>Cutting the petals</h3>
            <p>
              Use a very sharp knife or scalpel to cut the flower petals into
              the shape and size of the paper you need for the origami model.
              Try and pick areas that don’t have a lot of, or have very thick
              veins because it can be more difficult to cut or fold.
            </p>
            <h3>Making the origami model</h3>
            <p>
              This is where your skill and patience will be tested, as the paper
              will be delicate and not easy to work with even when it is
              optimally dried. However, if you are careful with the pre-creases
              you will find that there is less stress and pressure put on the
              model and you are less likely to cause tears at the creases.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you suspect that the flower petal is going to be too dry or
              brittle to work with, it is possible to try and moisten the
              material with a very tiny bit of water and let it soak into the
              petal. You can then test the consistency of the material by making
              a pre-crease to see if it is still too dry to fold, or pressing
              your finger onto the surface to see if the petal is too wet to
              retain the crease when you fold it.

          “Can you really make origami using flower petals?” he thought to
          himself. The name of the author has long faded because of the age of
          the book, so he wondered who would come up with such an idea and then
          write a book about it. Curious to find out more, and eager for an
          opportunity to talk to Rose again, he tucked the manuscript under his
          arms and continued looking through the other art books in the shop.
          The next day, the young man stopped by the florist with a big smile on
          his face. “I am surprised that you actually stopped by the shop
          today,” said Rose in a teasing manner, “do you have another friend you
          have to visit at the hospital?” He didn’t quite catch the tone of her
          voice, since he was so focused on showing the old manuscript to her
          and then asking if she had ever heard of anything like this before,
          and if it is something that is worth trying.

              unfortunate, because Rose wanted to know if the young came back
              because he wanted to see her, or if it was for another reason.
              Sometimes people try very hard to impress a person that they like,
              when all they really have to do is to listen more carefully and
              show that they care :)</q

          “I am a florist and not an origami artist, but it does sound very
          impressive…,” she said, sounding skeptical but also somewhat curious.
          “But why do you want to do something like this?” Even though Rose
          thought it was quite silly to try something like this, she
          nevertheless gave him an encouraging smile, since the young man seemed
          so determined to figure out if this was actually possible. So the
          young man left the shop with a small bag of rose petals left over from
          Valentine&#39;s Day from Rose with a mission to accomplish.
        </p>
        <p>
          The young man had set his heart on surprising Rose with an origami
          flower made from the rose petals, and he spent every spare moment he
          had reading and experimenting with the techniques in the manuscript.
          His rough and calloused hands, which are used to holding heavy tools
          and working at the construction site, were clearly not made for
          handling such delicate materials like flower petals. In fact he found
          it to be much harder than the work that he has to do every day, but in
          a different way. “But if I were to give up on this now, what chances
          would I have of becoming an artist like my mother, and also like
          Rose?” And because he would not give up on his goal to become an
          artist so easily, he was also determined to keep trying with the
          experiments.
        </p>
        <p>
          Days went by, then weeks and months. The young man would walk by the
          florist and wave, but he was not going inside the shop again until he
          could show Rose the origami flower. But one day he walked past the
          florist as usual and Rose was not there. “Maybe she is sick or just
          taking some time off from work?” he thought to himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Days went by, then weeks and months. The young man would walk by the
          florist as he always did, but the only reminder of Rose was the
          Oriental Lilies that she loved so much on display inside the glass
          window. “I wonder where she went…” the young man told the friend who
          he visited at the hospital with the Oriental Lilies a while ago. The
          young woman made a speedy recovery soon after his visit, and they
          became closer friends ever since. She thinks that it had something to
          do with watching the Oriental Lilies and taking her mind of the
          illness, so she was very grateful for the young man’s thoughtful
          visit. They would talk about many things but he never spoke to her
          about the manuscript or his feelings about the florist.

          “It’s funny you know,” she said to the young man, “there was a young
          lady in my art class who had won a scholarship to study overseas not
          long ago. But she had to sell everything that she owned and hardly had
          any time to get organized before she had to leave.” &quot;And what was
          her name?&quot; He asked, desperate to know if this was Rose on her
          way to realising her dream of becoming an artist.

        <p>
          &quot;I don&#39;t really remember to be honest... but her name kind of

          something rather interesting she mentioned before she left. Something
          about it being such a shame not to find out if it was really possible
          to make origami using flower petals.&quot;
