    <h1>Do Not Be Ashamed</h1>
    <h3>by Wendell Berry</h3>
    <p>
      <span class="first-letter">W</span>ill be walking some night<br />
      in the comfortable dark of your yard<br />
      and suddenly a great light will shine<br />
      round about you, and behind you<br />
      will be a wall you never saw before.
    </p>

    <p>
      <span>I</span>t will be clear to you suddenly<br />
      that you were about to escape,<br />
      and that you are guilty: you misread<br />
      the complex instructions, you are not<br />
      a member, you lost your card<br />
      or never had one.<br />
      And you will know<br />
      that they have been there all along,<br />
      their eyes on your letters and books,<br />
      their hands in your pockets,<br />
      their ears wired to your bed.
    </p>

    <p>
      <span>T</span>hough you have done nothing shameful,<br />
      they will want you to be ashamed.
    </p>

    <p>
      <span>T</span>hey will want you to kneel and weep<br />
      and say you should have been like them.
    </p>

    <p>
      <span>A</span>nd once you say you are ashamed,<br />
      reading the page they hold out to you,<br />
      then such light as you have made<br />
      in your history will leave you.
    </p>

    <p><span>T</span>hey will no longer need to pursue you.</p>

    <p><span>Y</span>ou will pursue them, begging forgiveness.</p>

    <p><span>T</span>hey will not forgive you.</p>

    <p><span>T</span>here is no power against them.</p>

    <p>
      <span>I</span>t is only candor that is aloof from them,<br />
      only an inward clarity, unashamed,<br />
      that they cannot reach.<br />
      Be ready.
    </p>

    <p>
      <span>W</span>hen their light has picked you out<br />
      and their questions are asked, say to them:<br />
      “I am not ashamed.<br />
      ” A sure horizon<br />
      will come around you.<br />
      The heron will begin<br />
      his evening flight from the hilltop.
