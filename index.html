             <p class="food-des">
             A Roast Chicken for a family dinner can be an ideal choice. A classic Chicken Roast recipe involves a basic blend of salt, pepper, garlic, onion and herbs. However, when it comes to Indian households, we love a generous spread of the spicy and aromatic masala marinade for the meat preparations. So why not make a roast chicken desi style? Here we share a roast chicken recipe that will not only give you juicy and moist chicken bites but will also satiate your taste buds with the splash of traditional Indian masalas.

             <h3 class="food-title">INSTRUCTIONS OR STEPS</h3>
             <p class="food-des">
             Pat the chicken dry. Then take a bowl and mix the ingredients such as chilli powder, ginger-garlic paste, pepper, cumin powder, honey, vinegar, butter and salt. Make a smooth paste. Lather this paste over the chicken. Make sure you spread the paste in the crevices as well. For an extra burst of flavour, use your fingers and loosen the skin away from the chicken breast and thighs and spread the marinade in these pockets over the meat. This way, you can trap the flavour between the meat and the skin. Cover the chicken and let it marinate for 2 hours.
             </p>
             <p class="food-des">
             Take the baking dish you will be using to roast the chicken. Add the vegetables such as onion, potatoes, garlic and lemon slices to the dish.
             </p>
             <p class="food-des">
             For the chicken to roast equally and retain the juices, tie the chicken legs together. Take a kitchen string and use it to tie the legs.
             </p>
             <p class="food-des">Transfer the chicken to the baking dish and bake it in the oven at 200 degrees celsius for 90 minutes or an hour. Make sure to keep brushing the chicken with butter or marinade every 30 minutes.</p>    
             <p class="food-des">Once the chicken is evenly roasted, take the tray out and cover the whole chicken with a foil. Let it rest for 10 minutes. Then squeeze a bit of lemon on top of the chicken and serve it with the baked vegetables.</p>
