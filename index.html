      <h1>How to make Tortilla Espa&ntildeola</h1>

      <h3>What is it?</h3>
      <p>
        Spanish omelette, Spanish tortilla or Tortilla Espa&ntildeola is a
        traditional dish from Spain and one of the signature dishes in the
        Spanish cuisine. It is an omelette made with eggs and potatoes,
        optionally including onion. It is often served at room temperature as a
        tapa.
      </p>

      <h3>Nomenclature</h3>
      <p>
        As the dish has gained international popularity, and perhaps to avoid
        being mixed up with the thin flatbread made out of wheat or maize
        popular in parts of Latin America such as Mexico and Central America,
        the espa&ntildeola or Spanish naming gained traction. As such, Spanish
        omelette or Spanish tortilla are its common names in English, while
        tortilla espa&ntildeola is formally accepted name even within the
        peninsula.

      <h3>How to</h3>

      The most common procedure to cook a Spanish omelette is as follows:
      <ul>
        <li>
          The potatoes, ideally a starchy variety, are cut into thin slices or
          small dice.
        </li>
        <li>
          They are then seasoned and saut√©ed in vegetable oil, ideally olive
          oil, with sliced onions being added at this stage if used. These
          ingredients are stirred at a moderate temperature until they are soft
          but not brown.
        </li>
        <li>
          The potatoes (and onions, if included) are then removed, drained, and
          mixed with whisked eggs.
        </li>
        <li>
          This mixture is then returned to the pan and slowly grilled, turning
          the omelette to grill both sides.[1][18]
        </li>
        <li>
          Once the eggs are cooked on one side, a plate is placed over the
          mixture so the pan can be inverted.
        </li>
        <li>
          The mixture is then slipped back into the pan to cook the other
          side.[19]
        </li>
      </ul>
