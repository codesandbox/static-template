        <p>
          My name is Alina Zaman. I’m currently a senior in high school and I
          have been a Girl Scout for 13 years. I decided to complete my Gold
          Award during my junior year. I wanted to reach a large audience of
          teenagers and young adults who may or may not have someone they can
          reach out to. Mental Health is a very important thing and many times
          is ignored due to other critical aspects of our lives. However, we
          should always take that moment to care for ourselves and learn about
          how to cope with the stress of our everyday lives. I decided to
          complete my Gold Award for the sole reason of helping those who are
          unsure of how to help themselves.

        <h1>About My Project</h1>
        <br />
        <p>
          My project aims to target the issue of mental health in teens, which
          often goes highly undiscussed. It has always been an ongoing issue and
          I know many of you might not be comfortable opening up to anyone.
          However, you shouldn’t have to deal with everything alone. Whether
          it’s you or a friend or just someone you know who is going through a
          hard time, everyone should be educated on ways to cope with these
          issues. This is a safe place for you to learn more about how you feel
          and how to control your emotions and work on coping and healing.
