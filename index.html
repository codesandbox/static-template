      <h2>About the kingdom</h2>
      <p>
        In pre-Hellenistic Greco-Roman geography, Colchis[a] or Kolchis was an
        exonym for the Georgian polity[b] of Egrisi[c] located on the coast of
        the Black Sea, centered in present-day western Georgia. It has been
        described in modern scholarship as "the earliest Georgian formation"
        which, along with the Kingdom of Iberia, would later contribute
        significantly to the development of the medieval Georgian statehood and
        the Georgian nation. Colchis is known in Greek mythology as the
        destination of the Argonauts, as well as the home to Medea and the
        Golden Fleece. It was also described as a land rich with gold, iron,
        timber and honey that would export its resources mostly to ancient
        Hellenic city-states.

      <p id="myText">
        Colchis was populated by Colchians, an early Kartvelian-speaking tribe,
        ancestral to the contemporary western Georgians, namely Svans and Zans.
        Its geography is mostly assigned to what is now the western part of
        Georgia and encompasses the present-day Georgian provinces of Samegrelo,
        Imereti, Guria, Adjara, Abkhazeti, Svaneti, Racha; modern Russia's Sochi
        and Tuapse districts; and present-day Turkeyâ€™s Artvin, Rize, and Trabzon
        provinces.
