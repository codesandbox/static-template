<h1 id="running-any-npm-pacakge-in-the-browser-locally">Running any NPM pacakge in the browser locally</h1>

<p>JavaScript has never had any official solution for distributing
packages, and every web platform (Rails, Django etc) has their own idea
of how to structure and package JavaScript. In the last few years NPM
has started becoming the canonical way of distribution, with Webpack as
the build system, but there’s no way to load NPM packages in the browser
without a server-side component.</p>

<p>Scrimba is a platform for interactive coding screencast where you can
run the code at any moment in time. Being able to use NPM packages has
been a frequently requested feature, but it turns out to be surprisingly
technically difficult to implement. In this article I will explain how
we tackled the problem and the final solution we ended up with.</p>

<p>Our solution (inspired by StackBlitz) runs almost entirely on the
client-side. Dependency resolution is done server-side, but
fetching NPM files, parsing <code>require()</code>, resolving require paths and
creating a bundle is all done at the client. This (combined with
IndexedDB caching) gives a smooth experience with very low latency.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-involved-in-supporting-npm">What is involved in supporting NPM?</h2>

<p>There are two very distinct steps in supporting NPM: Dependency
resolution and module loading.</p>

<p><strong>Dependency resolution</strong> is about going from a dependency requirement,</p>

<div class="language-json highlighter-coderay"><div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre><span class="line-numbers"><a href="#n1" name="n1">1</a></span><span style="color:#606"><span style="color:#404">&quot;</span><span>dependencies</span><span style="color:#404">&quot;</span></span>: {

<span class="line-numbers"><a href="#n4" name="n4">4</a></span>}
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>to a concrete description of what packages needs to be installed:</p>

<pre><code>node_modules/react       react@16.0.0
node_modules/react-dom   react-dom@16.0.0
node_modules/fbjs        fbjs@0.8.16
...
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Module loading</strong> is more involved and includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Figuring out that <code>require("react")</code> in app.js refers to
node_modules/react/index.js</li>
  <li>Making sure dependencies are available before the module body is being executed</li>
  <li>Providing <code>exports</code>, <code>module</code>, <code>process</code> variables inside the module
body</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="dependency-resolution">Dependency resolution</h2>

<p><a href="https://yarnpkg.com/">Yarn</a> is a package manager for NPM which you
<em>can</em> use a library. There is not a public API available at the moment,
but as long as you depend on a fixed version everything works out
nicely. Yarn has a <code>PackageResolver</code> which resolves all dependencies,
and with the <code>PackageHoister</code> you can find the paths where packages
needs to be installed. Yarn is decently decoupled and although it lacks
documentation about the internal classes it’s quite easy to figure
things out.</p>

<p class="aside">
    Yarn 1.3 was recently released and includes a bunch of new features!
</p>

<h2 id="module-loader-webpack">Module loader: Webpack</h2>

<p>There are some online coding sandboxes
(<a href="https://www.webpackbin.com/">Webpackbin</a> and
<a href="https://codesandbox.io/">CodeSandbox</a>) which supports NPM packages
through server-side Webpack. Their approach is essentially as follows:</p>

<p>First they have a <em>packager</em> which takes a list of fully resolved packages
(e.g <code>react@16.0.0,react-dom@16.0.0</code>), generates a <code>package.json</code>,
install packages and dependencies with <code>yarn</code>, and then uses Webpack to
build a <a href="https://webpack.js.org/plugins/dll-plugin/">DLL package</a>. A DLL
package is a way of bundling all files into a single Webpack bundle.
Packaging can take a while (&gt;10s), but it’s only needed once per request
and you can cache the produced package indefinitely.</p>

<p>When you want to execute your app.js you send it to the server, generate
a Webpack configuration (which includes a reference to the DLL package)
and Webpack will resolve everything for you.</p>

<p>There are two big disadvantages with this approach:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Building the initial package can take a <em>long</em> time. This needs
to be done on the server-side and its scalability is limited by how
many servers you have.</li>
  <li>Packages can only be cached as a whole. This means that if you add one
small dependency you must still create a whole new package.</li>
</ul>

<p>We created a prototype together with Christian Alfoni (the creator of
Webpackbin), but had some pending work when we discovered a different
approach.</p>

<h2 id="module-loader-unpkg--systemjs">Module loader: Unpkg + SystemJS</h2>

<p><a href="https://stackblitz.com/">StackBlitz</a> is an online coding sandbox which
supports NPM without using Webpack at all. They briefly described their approach
in a
<a href="https://github.com/unpkg/unpkg-website/issues/35#issuecomment-317128917">comment at the unpkg-repo</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In short, SystemJS &amp; Unpkg are an incredible duo for dev UX because
they reflect what makes local dev environments great: the client is
doing all of the downloading, installing, bundling, and even serving
the application.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They haven’t open-sourced their solution yet, but from their description
we can still go through how it works. Let’s say we have an app.js which
contains the following:</p>

<div class="language-javascript highlighter-coderay"><div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre><span class="line-numbers"><a href="#n1" name="n1">1</a></span><span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">import</span> React from <span style="background-color:hsla(0,100%,50%,0.05)"><span style="color:#710">'</span><span style="color:#D20">react</span><span style="color:#710">'</span></span>;
<span class="line-numbers"><a href="#n2" name="n2">2</a></span><span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">import</span> ReactDOM from <span style="background-color:hsla(0,100%,50%,0.05)"><span style="color:#710">'</span><span style="color:#D20">react-dom</span><span style="color:#710">'</span></span>;
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This can be defined as a module in SystemJS and it will start doing its
magic. The required paths (<code>react</code> and <code>react-dom</code>) will be extracted
and attempted resolved. By writing a SystemJS-plugin we can integrate
with <a href="https://unpkg.com/">Unpkg</a> and fetch files directly from NPM
packages:</p>

<ul>
  <li>First we can load <a href="https://unpkg.com/react@16.0.0/package.json">https://unpkg.com/react@16.0.0/package.json</a> to find
the main file. In this case it’s <code>index.js</code>.</li>
  <li>Then we can fetch <a href="https://unpkg.com/react@16.0.0/index.js">https://unpkg.com/react@16.0.0/index.js</a> directly
and register it as a SystemJS module.</li>
  <li>SystemJS will extract the required paths from this file and
recursively fetch/register all dependent files.</li>
  <li>Once everything is complete we can execute our original app.js.</li>
</ul>

<p>From StackBlitz’ description we implemented a prototype in Scrimba, and
we had the following experiences:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It turns out that SystemJS’s built-in resolve logic doesn’t completely
match Node’s, and there’s quite a few packages which depends on Node’s
behaviour. We ended up writing our custom path resolver.</li>
  <li>SystemJS is slow. Even though we cached the content of the files and
did no HTTP requests at all, it took around 150ms to just resolve all
dependencies. It seems to be caused by heavily use of Promises which
causes overhead when there’s no asynchronicity.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the end we felt we needed to re-invent many parts of SystemJS in
order to get the correct behaviour, and the parts left of SystemJS were
slow or not in use.</p>

<h2 id="module-loader-custom-loader-our-approach">Module loader: Custom loader (our approach)</h2>

<p>Our final solution uses a module loader we wrote for our use case. It
consists of several decoupled parts which combines into a complete
solution. The project is called “mrmanager” and is currently not
open-sourced, but if there’s interest we can make it happen.</p>

<p>First there’s a virtual <strong>file system</strong>. The file system handles require
path resolution and integrates with Unpkg to fetch NPM files.</p>

<p>Then we have the <strong>module system</strong>. This provides a way to register modules

</pre></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Note that the module system does <em>not</em> parse require paths or fetch
dependencies, and you must handle this at a different level. It’s your
responsibilty to define all modules before you attempt to execute them.
This is a way of simplifying the module system to its most basic
features and allowing for different approaches to dependency handling.</p>

<p>The final piece of the puzzle is the <strong>loader</strong>. The loader combines the
module system with the file system such that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The loader will use the file system to fetch the code</li>
  <li>It will parse the code for dependencies, fetch the dependencies,
resolve all paths and make sure everything is available. This is done
recursively.</li>
  <li>The code will be wrapped inside a <code>system.define(name, function() { … }</code>-block</li>
  <li>The wrapped code for <em>all</em> files is concatenated together to one big
string</li>
  <li>Once all dependencies are loaded, it will execute the code once. This
will register every file to the module system, and we’re now ready to
invoke the main file.</li>
</ul>

<p>The crucial part here (compared to SystemJS) is that we combine all the
processed files into one big string and (1) execute it at once and (2)
cache it all together. In SystemJS the only unit you can cache is a
<em>file</em> and SystemJS will every time re-parse require paths, resolve
those paths and so on.</p>

<p>This is a good example of how decoupling two system (the module system
and the dependency system) gives us greater flexibility even though
we’re always going to use them together. By decoupling them we have
clearly defined what the module system needs to function. After careful
consideration we found a way to cache this in the most performant way.</p>

<p>The end result? From a hot cache, mrmanager is capable of executing
React (with ReactDOM) in 9ms instead of SystemJS’ 150ms. Those
milliseconds matter when you want to quickly iterate on small projects.</p>

<p>I must again clarify that it was not only performance which lead us to a
custom approach. In our SystemJS-prototype we ended up using just a
fraction of SystemJS, reinventing parts of it, and monkey-patching
various functions. That’s not a criticism of SystemJS itself, but a sign
that it hasn’t been designed for our use case.</p>
