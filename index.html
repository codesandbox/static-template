      I am a sixteen year old high school student who is passionate about
      preserving and protecting our oceans. I also play ice hockey for the Northwest Stars. With the Stars, I have traveled to cities such as Dallas and
      Omaha. I learned a little about programing when I took robotics in seventh grade. Programming was also included in my Geometry class in ninth grade. I do not have a clear direction for my future plans with programming, but I know will use my skills in the future.
