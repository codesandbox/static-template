      <p class="paragraph"> Tom Colicchio, award-winning restaurateur, Top Chef head judge, 
        and food activist, founded the beloved Manhattan restaurant Craft in 2001, 
        quickly snagging three stars from the New York Times and helping to popularize
        farm-to-table dining. After New York was attacked on 9/11, Craft not only survived, 
        but in the ensuing 19 years, it spawned a fine-dining mini-empire, with several 
        outposts in New York, another in Los Angeles, and two in Las Vegas.
      </p> <byline>Tom Colicchio is and award winning restaurant owner, top in the culinary field</byline>
   
    <p>Now New York is facing another unthinkable catastrophe — this time, along with the 
      entire world — and the restaurant industry is threatened as never before. Last week, Danny Meyer, 
      Colicchio’s one-time partner, shut down all 19 of his storied establishments, laying off 2,000 
      people — some 80% of his workforce. Thomas Keller furloughed 1,200. And Colicchio has done the same, 
      laying off all but a few of his 300 employees.
    </p><byline>New York is facing anohter catastrophe with the corona virus.</byline>

    <p>Recognizing an existential crisis for his industry — with many other sectors of the economy sure to 
      follow — Colicchio has turned his attention to defending independent restaurants and their 11 million 
      employees around the country from total devastation. The provisions he fought for were passed by Congress 
      earlier this week. If there’s any lesson to be learned from the crisis, he says, it’s that unchecked
      capitalism — from the obsession with quarterly earnings to the profits-at-any-cost mentality of our captains 
      of industry — has failed us. Perhaps a more thoughtful approach awaits us on the other side. He shared his 
      experience with Marker.

    <p class="paragraph"> I'm a news junkie, so I was aware of what Covid-19 was doing to China, and about a month ago I started to 
      realize it had a real potential to spread around the world. I had seen Bill Gates talk about this, and it 
      was clear we weren’t prepared, especially given how contagious this virus seemed to be. Meanwhile, we saw the 
      leadership of the country in total denial. Listening to the president downplay the danger, I thought, “We’re 
      screwed. We’re not going to have the response we need.”
    </p> <byline>Colichhi talks about Covad 19</byline>

    <p>About a week after that, we saw a huge drop-off in reservations for large parties. Our Vegas restaurants do a big 
      conference business, and within a day, they all canceled.

       it to pay bills from 30, 45 days ago.
    </p>

    <p>I got my executive group together — myself, the COO, director of HR, director of finance, the executive chef over 
      all the restaurants — and we started making adjustments. We stopped purchasing wine and any nonessential items and
       started talking about staffing levels.

    <p>Cash flow is our lifeblood. We look at that more than any other metric. When we bring in revenue, we’re using it 
      to pay bills from 30, 45 days ago. Anything extra we’ve been putting into the business. In the past 12 months, we 
      opened a restaurant — that cost close to $1 million — and we renovated our private dining room at Craft to make it 
      a breakfast and lunch spot. That was about $350,000.
    </p><byline>Collicio talks about the importance of cashflow</byline>

    <p>The night of March 12, I realized we were probably going to have to shut everything down. I called Danny Meyer the 
      next morning. We’re ex-partners, but we’re still close, and whenever there’s something big going on in our industry,
       I like to bounce ideas off him. He said they were thinking the same thing. The day after that, the government shut 
       down the whole industry except for takeout and delivery.
    </p><byline>collicio talks about his experience.</byline>

    <p>That didn’t seem like the right move for us. There’s that picture of delivery people waiting outside Carbone. I 
      think you’ve got to ask yourself a question: Are you willing to put your staff at risk? Because that’s what happening 
      here. Look, if you’re feeding health care workers, people providing essential services, I think that’s fine. If you’re
       serving $60 veal parmesans, maybe not.
    </p><byline>The delivery martket is up.</byline>

    <p>Between four restaurants in New York and one in L.A., we employ 300 people. There are also two Craft restaurants in Las 
      Vegas, which we manage but don’t own. The initial plan was to bring as many staffers as possible into the East 19th Street
       space and tell them personally. It didn’t feel right to do it by email. But I woke up the following morning and just thought,
        “There is no way I want all these people in one big space. It’s too dangerous.” We wound up calling people instead.

    <p class="quote">The impact is way beyond us. It works its way through the food chain: You’re talking about fishermen, farmers, suppliers.
    </p>

    <p>We have a policy where staff members get gift certificates to eat in any of our restaurants in exchange for offering feedback. 
      That Sunday night, I showed up for our last service before closing, and a bartender who has been with me since the beginning — 19 
      years — was sitting there with his wife and his young daughter. I got choked up. I realized I couldn’t fall to pieces in front of his 
      little girl, but it’s really emotional. Especially at Craft, we’ve all known each other for a long time. Telling your employees you’re 
      closing is the hardest thing in the world.
    </p><byline>We have a policy where staff members get gift certificates to eat</byline>

    <p>Nobody was angry. They were scared; they were emotional; they were worried about each other. But there was a real sense of, “Hey, we’re 
      in this together.”
    </p>

    <p>Plus, the impact is way beyond us. It works its way through the food chain: You’re talking about fishermen, farmers, suppliers. I was talking 
      to an oyster farmer on the south shore of Long Island. He doesn’t know what to do. He’s scrambling to put together a home delivery service. There
      are crops in fields that just got picked — what do you do with them? Some farmers markets are open, but you set up your tables, and people aren’t
      coming out.
    </p><byline>It works its way through the food chain: You’re talking about fishermen, farmers, suppliers.</byline>

    <p>As for our staff, we made the last payroll, and that was it. I kept a handful of my senior people together, because if we reopen — when we 
      reopen — I’ll need them to make it happen. But they all took 50% pay cuts. There was no way around it.
    </p><byline>Collicio talks about paying his staff</byline>
    <!--This will be highlighted green with a side note saying "Top highlighted-->
    <p>One thing that’s not well understood about the industry is that the profit margins are so thin. If you’re doing 10%, that’s good. Of course, 
      we try to pay shareholders and partners as best we can, but when you’re running a restaurant, there’s a certain amount of upkeep you can’t neglect.
    </p><byline>The industry of profit margin</byline>

    <p>I think we were in better shape than some. We’d paid off most of our debt. But because money has been cheap over the past couple years, and it’s been 
      like grow, grow, grow, a lot of restaurant groups went to banks and took out big loans, figuring, “Well, the money’s coming in. We’ll be okay.” Then the 
      cash flow stops dead. A lot of companies are in big trouble.
    </p>

    <p>People started talking about setting up GoFundMe pages, doing fundraisers, and all that. But this is no time to pass the tip cup. I’ve been working on 
      hunger issues for a long time, and I’ve seen how the charitable response winds up masking the need for government intervention. This problem was too big 
      for charity. Our government needs to step up.
    </p>

    <!--light gray paragraph, centered with big px-->
    <p class="quote">This exposes the limits of our system and what happens when capitalism is unchecked. Even CEOs of big companies are starting to recognize something’s off.
    </p>

    <p>I made a few calls, and we pulled together a bunch of people, knitted a few groups and constituencies together, created a working group, hired lobbyists 
      and a comms team, and got to work. Within two days, we launched the Independent Restaurant Coalition. I think there are 500 members so far. The main objective 
      is to make sure independent restaurants would be able to tap into whatever stimulus Congress puts together. I’m not saying the National Restaurant Association 
      doesn’t represent us, but they’re also looking out for big chains. We needed our own group.
    </p>

    <p>The Senate just passed the CARES Act, and it contains all the key provisions we pushed for, including four months of unemployment and loans to restaurants, 
      with forgiveness to cover expenses and payroll.
    </p>

    <p>The optimist in me looks at this as an opportunity for the country to examine its priorities. This is devastating for so many people, but on the positive side, 
      it exposes the limits of our system and what happens when capitalism is unchecked. Even CEOs of big companies are starting to recognize something’s off. The focus 
      on quarterly earnings — we need to see the end of that. All the outsourcing of manufacturing to China, now we see the pitfalls of that. Maybe it’s okay to make a little 
      less profit so the economy can survive shocks like this. Because it will happen again.
    </p><byline>The optimist in me looks at this as an opportunity for the country</byline>

    <p>For years, we’ve been fed the idea that big government is bad. And I agree, dumb big government is bad. What we need is smart government that’s going to understand 
      the needs of real people and be responsive. And we’re seeing that now. People are starting to realize the role government has to play.
    </p>

    <p>I’ve spent the past week doing interviews and organizing the response, eight in the morning till 10 at night. But I’m stuck at home like everyone else. I’m at our home
       in Brooklyn, working from a makeshift office set up at the dining room table, trying not to kill my kids. We have three boys—nine, 10, and 26. My wife and I are trying 
       to keep things as normal as possible. We had a birthday party for one of my sons the other day on Zoom. We play card games. Sushi Go! and Exploding Kittens are the current
      favorites. And, of course, I’ve been cooking. I started getting into sourdough a few months ago. I’ve got my starter going, and I probably bake a loaf of bread every other day now.
    </p><byline>interviews and organizing the response, eight in the morning till 10 at night</byline>

    <p>As for the future, I think the industry will survive. People are always going to want to come together to celebrate and share meals. Restaurants aren’t going away, but I do 
      wonder what they’re going to look like. I’ve been asking my staff to think about how we can reinvent things. It will change for sure.
    </p>

    <p>I think the bigger question is what does business look like, period. Does this grease the skids for national health care and finally move the burden away from small businesses?
       What we’re seeing now is how fragile the whole system is. Hopefully we’ll come out of it and build something stronger and better for everyone.
