    <h2>Looping a triangle</h2>
    <p>
      1. Write a loop that makes seven calls to console.log to output the
      following triangle:
    </p>
    <pre>
      # 
      ## 
      ### 
      #### 
      ##### 
      ###### 
      #######
    </pre>
    <h2>FizzBuzz</h2>
    <p>
      2. Write a program that uses console.log to print all the numbers from 1
      to 100, with two exceptions. For numbers divisible by 3, print "Fizz"
      instead of the number, and for numbers divisible by 5 (and not 3), print
      "Buzz" instead.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you have that working, modify your program to print "FizzBuzz" for
      numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5 (and still print "Fizz" or
      "Buzz" for numbers divisible by only one of those).
    </p>
    <p>
      (This is actually an interview question that has been claimed to weed out
      a significant percentage of programmer candidates. So if you solved it,
      your labor market value just went up.)
    </p>
    <h2>Chessboard</h2>
    <p>
      Write a program that creates a string that represents an 8Ã—8 grid, using
      newline characters to separate lines. At each position of the grid there
      is either a space or a "#" character. The characters should form a
      chessboard.
    </p>
    <p>Passing this string to console.log should show something like this:</p>
    <pre>
        # # # #
        # # # # 
         # # # #
        # # # # 
         # # # #
        # # # # 
         # # # #
        # # # #
    </pre>
    <p>
      When you have a program that generates this pattern, define a binding size
      = 8 and change the program so that it works for any size, outputting a
      grid of the given width and height.
    </p>
