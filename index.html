        <h2>What is permaculture?</h2>
        <br />
        <h4>
          Permaculture is a concept and method to land management that is based
          on the arrangements seen in healthy natural ecosystems. It consists of
          a collection of design concepts developed from whole-systems thinking.
          It applies these ideas to regenerative agriculture, rewilding, and
          community resilience, among other things.

          <h2>Acquaint yourself with your surroundings.</h2>
          <p>
            Familiarize yourself with the native plants, insects, and predators
            that inhabit your region and planting area. Observe which parts of
            the garden get the most sun.

          <h2>Choose plants based on your environment.</h2>
          <p>
            When deciding what to plant, do some research and which annual and
            perennial plants will thrive in your surrounding habitat. Plant
            flowers that attract butterflies, grow herbs that repel harmful
            insects from fruit trees, and choose nitrogen-fixing, green manure
            crops that will gradually increase the nutrients in your soil over
            time.

          <h2>Design your garden layout.</h2>
          <p>
            During the design process, consider your light requirements, water
            sources, and the existing landscape to determine where to grow each
            type of plant. Use plant stacking to maximize space. Start by
            growing your taller plants first, so that shade cover is in place
            for any smaller plants that are sensitive to direct sunlight.
            Double-check your design to make sure plants with similar water and
            sun requirements are grouped together.

          <h2>Add a layer of organic mulch to the topsoil.</h2>
          <p>
            Chemical weed killers don't align with the principles of
            permaculture gardening, so make sure you add a layer of organic
            mulch after planting to suppress weeds and keep your soil moist.
            Common types of mulch include leaves, newspaper, straw, wood chips,
            shredded bark, and grass clippings.

          <h2>Add compost without disturbing the soil.</h2>
          <p>
            Avoid chemical fertilizers and instead, use a natural compost filled
            with organic matter. Popular composting choices include manure and
            kitchen scraps that you can collect in a compost bin. Earthworm
            castings and worm tea are also great options, as they are extremely
            rich in nutrients and add beneficial microbes to your soil.

          <h2>Use an efficient and sustainable watering system.</h2>
          <p>
            Make sure you're using the minimum amount of water needed for your
            garden to thrive. A low-waste drip irrigation system is a great
            choice to directly water your soil with minimal evaporation. Collect
            rain run-off from your roof gutters that you can recycle into your
            watering system.
