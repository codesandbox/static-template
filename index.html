    <h1>Jack and Jill Poem</h1>
    <p>
      Jack and Jill went up the hill <br />
      To fetch a pail of water Jack fell down and broke his crown <br />
      And Jill came tumbling after <br />
      Up Jack got, and home did trot <br />
      As fast as he could caper <br />
      He went to bed to mend his head <br />
      With vinegar and brown paper <br />
