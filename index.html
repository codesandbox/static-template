					<p> My name is Max Trilling, I am in the 9th grade at Windward School. This year is my first real year of programming, when I was younger I did do a little bit of simple Java Script. My hope for the future is that I will have a good understanding of how to build websites, enough to where I could create a website for something like a business in the future.</p>
