                <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>January 2021 -</strong> The Journey of 21 years Started In a Hostel Dorm Bed in Panama. The remotely operated website/social network HoboTraveler, where you can meet friends in more than 100 countries just turned 21.  Andy Lee Graham, the founder, is a remote worker and a backpacker who has traveled non-stop for 23 years. He has no home, works from hotels, and has been to 112 countries, and is one of the pioneers of the digital nomad movement. Andy started traveling in 1998. In January 2000, he bought a domain and began building the website HoboTraveler.com. After some years, Andy met his partner Andrew Suares, and they have worked together for more than 15 years, building and maintaining the website. While Andy worked from hostels and hotel rooms in different countries, he connected virtually with Andrew, who worked in Goa,  India, and workers in other locations around the world. Together, they achieved the dream of building a network for travelers to contribute to and benefit from while working from a distance and without physical contact.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">With HoboTraveler, you can make friends online and meet them offline. No need to worry about meeting fake members because HoboTraveler has a strict policy that eliminates anonymous members. Each member is required to pay a $25 fee. These fees are used to pay staff whose job is to validate the authenticity of the information used by the member in signing up.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">This verification step is important for the safety of other members. Unverified members have restricted access for a limited time; it is only after being verified that a member can have full access to the website and its resources. The website is built on truth, trust, and honesty, so you must be who you say you are. You must use your real name and real profile photos. No wonder it is a haven for those who want to spend less money traveling, and more time meeting friends and exploring the world.</p>
