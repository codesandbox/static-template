  <h2> Welcome! You’ve Found the Easiest Way to Learn HTML and CSS.</h2>
  <p>
    <em>Our step-by-step guide teaches you the basics of HTML and how to build your first website. That means how to
      layout an HTML page, how to add text and images, how to add headings and text formatting, and how to use
      tables.</em>
  </p>


  <h3><strong>What is HTML?</strong></h3>
  <p>
    HTML is the heart of the entire web. Whatever content we see online is based on HTML. If you simply right-click on
    any web page and click on View Source, you will be able to see loads of tags, the first one being <html> which means
    the document is an HTML file.

      Projects are the most practical way to learn any language, and HTML is no exception. To build any website, you
      need a basic understanding of HTML and if you want interactive custom websites, just knowing the cheat sheet is
      not enough – you should be able to implement your knowledge practically.

      Every language, software, hardware, etc. has technical documentation for information and help. Here is how you can
      create a simple documentation page, with internal linking from the left navigation to the content on the right of
      the page. You can check out the documentation for Python, Java, Arduino, etc. for reference on how these pages
      look. Most technical documentation has multiple hierarchies and pages; however, for simplicity, we have created a
      simple project to start. You can expand it further and add it as per your wish. Technical documentation could be a
      beneficial HTML project if you are just starting with your HTML career.

      In this project, we will create a simple page, where a car will appear to move on a road. The simple project is a
      perfect example of how animations can be made easily and quickly. Look out for the use of tag for creating this
      simple animation. Try adding more objects and making them move in different directions for more fun.
