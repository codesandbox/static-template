        The Little Stars is located at the top end of Jupiter High Street,
        making it an ideal location for families living in Merry Hill, Notting
        Hill, Holland Park and South Kensington. Children can start at the age
        of one and stay with us until the age of six. Our spacious classrooms
        are bright and airy, and provide the children with ample room for all
        the activities our nursery offers. We have strong ties with many of the
        leading private schools in London and we will prepare your child for
        entry into the school of your choice. Our goal is to provide a safe and
        caring environment, where children can gain a positive approach to
        school and learning. They will learn to care for, and respect each
        other, whilst learning how to be part of a group.

        Good nursery education is crucial to a child's formative years, and
        fosters an enthusiasm and confidence that will remain with them
        throughout their school life. Our experienced and dedicated staff help
        the children to become successful learners, confident individuals, and
        caring contributors to society. The children learn through play and
        structured lessons, with a balance of free choice. It is widely accepted
        that children in this age group absorb and achieve more than at any
        other stage in their school life, and this makes choosing the right
        nursery school vital.
