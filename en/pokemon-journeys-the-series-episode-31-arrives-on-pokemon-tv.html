              The 31st episode of the 23rd season of
              <em>Pokémon the Series</em> is now on Pokémon TV

              Goh’s family is vacationing in Azalea Town for the first time in
              three years! But when Goh thinks about the last time, he remembers
              a boy named Horace. Goh and Horace became fast friends, sharing
              their knowledge of Pokémon as they searched for a shrine where
              Celebi was sighted. But after promising to meet up again, Horace
              didn’t return.
            </p>
            <p class="article">
              This time, Goh finds the shrine—and a note from Horace. In the
              note, Horace apologizes and explains that he couldn’t meet up
              again because he got sick. As Goh finishes reading, he hears a
              voice—it’s Horace! As the two start to catch up, a pair of Celebi
              fly overhead…
