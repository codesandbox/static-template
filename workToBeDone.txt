What have I acheieved so far?
1. Built the database for industry and products
2. Built the recommendation engine that:
  - if a product on an industry's list is a "must-have" 
  - then we call a function called findTheLargestSumInsured() and return the largest sum insured for each of the recommended products
  - we will need to rename this functinon, since it's not just finding the largest sum insured but will also be executing the logic for recommended plans
  
Things that need to be built:
1. Receiving user input from differernt points:
  1. From industry, funding, revenue input fields
    - once I've done this I should test if the above recommendation engine works properly
  2. Selections for the final estimate page
    - Product radio button selections
    - Changing of SI

What should happen when I add a product?
1. The selection's UI should reflect the change
2. Find the largest SI for that 
  

Set the status of all the select fields to null when its not selected


Things that you need to do when a product is chosen:
1. checkTheCheckbox() - will tick the checkbox and add the selectedClass (1)
2. setSumInsuredFieldStatus(selectedProduct, selectStatus, largestSI) - if(select field is true) -> onSelection will activate the select field (3)
3. calculation() - if(select field is true) -> will do the calculation for the price and add it to the UI (4)
4. findTheLargestSumInsured() - will find the largest SI for the selected product (2)




Points of logic:
1. When the fourth continue button is clicked:
if(recommendation=no)
Hide the product

if(recommendedPlan is empty) -> case when user goes back and changes some field
- findRecommendedProducts(entireproducts array)
else()
- findTheLargestSumInsured(entireproducts array, fundingRound, revenueAmount)

2. When a product is chosen on the final estimate page
- checkTheBox()
Running a loop to find out the selected product element (HTML element) -> stored in specificProductElement
- findTheLargestSumInsured()

- setSumInsuredFieldStatus()
- calculation()



function setSumInsuredFieldStatus(selectedProduct, selectStatus, largestSI) {
  if (selectStatus) {
    var siField = $(`[data-si='${selectedProduct}']`);
    siField[0].value = largestSI; //replace with data-variable
    siField.prop("disabled", false);
  } else $(`[data-si='${selectedProduct}']`).prop("disabled", true);
}





Features:
- will select the recommended products
- will select the recommended SI
- will not show products that aren't recommended 
- will calculate the largest SI based on revenue and funding round
- database of products and their relevant values
