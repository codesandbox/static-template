          From Father Christmas to Saint Nicholas
        </h1>
        Santa Claus, also known as Father Christmas, Saint Nicholas, Saint Nick,
        Kris Kringle, or simply as Santa, is a legendary figure originating from
        Western Christian Culture. He is said to bring gifts to children who are
        nice, and coal to children who are naughty. The modern character of
        Santa is based on the fourth-century Greek bishop and gift-giver of Myra
        (a town on the Mediterranean coast of Turkey, now known as Demre), Saint
        Nicholas. He is also based on the British figure of Father Christmas,
        and the Dutch figure Sinterklaas (who is also based upon Saint
        Nicholas). Santa Claus is generally depicted as a jolly, portly,
        white-bearded man, with ruddy cheeks and often spectacles, or glasses.
        He wears a red coat with white fur cuffs, a black leather belt and
        boots, carrying a sack of gifts for children. He is said to deliver
        gifts to children all over the world on Christmas eve. Santa is said to
        accomplish this feat with the help of his elves, who makes gifts in the
        North Pole, which is also where Santa is said to reside when he is not
        delivering gifts, as well as with the help of his flying reindeer, who
        pull a sleigh to deliver gifts. Saint Nicholas is one of the many major
        figues that Santa Claus is based upon. As stated earlier, Saint Nicholas
        was a fourth-century Greek bishop. He is most well known (besides for
        being the person that Santa is based on) for giving generous gifts to
        the poor. He was very religious from a young age and devoted his life
        wholly to Christianity. He is usually portrayed as a bearded bishop in
        robes. Father Christmas is also a major figure that Santa Claus was is
        based on. Father Christmas is the spirit of good cheer at Christmas,
        bringing peace, joy, good food and wine. His physical appearance varies,
        but the most famous image being John Leech's illustration of the "Ghost
        of Christmas Present" in Charles Dicken's classic "A Christmas Carol".
        Another predecessor of Santa's was Kris Kringle, a personification of
        the baby Jesus who, in German-speaking parts of Europe, takes the place
        of Santa in bringing gifts to people at Christmas time. The tradition of
        Santa Claus entering homes through the chimney is shared by many
        European gift-givers. In pre-Christian Norse tradition, Odin would often
        enter through chimneys and fire holes on the solstice. In the United
        states and Canada, children typically leave a glass of milk and cookies
        indented for Santa to eat; in Britain and Australia, sherry or beet, as
        well as mince pies are left instead. In Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, it
        is common for children to leave him rice porridge with sugar and
        cinnamon instead. In Ireland, it is common to leave Guinness (an Irish
        beer) or milk, along with Christmas pudding or mince pies. Santa's
        signature catchphrase, "Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!" is a textual
        rendition of a deep laugh or chuckle, associated with Santa Claus, as
        well as Father Christmas. <br /><br /><br /><br />
