      <h1>My name is Jerome Biggins</h1>
      <p>
        I've worked in the Information Technology field for 10+ years. I
        discovered my passion for technology at a young age when my mother
        bought our first VCR. She was having trouble trying to get it to work
        and didn't understand the features of it. So I played with it until I
        understood how it worked then showed her how to do it. She pointed out
        to me how good I was with this and the rest is history. I take great
        passion in helping others by solving their technical problems which is
        why I wanted to become a front-end web developer.
      </p>
      <p>
        While working as a IT technician, I would always get asked if I was able
        to build websites. I've always been fascinated with the web and always
        wanted to learn how it works, so one time, I took a course in PHP and
        when I saw how it helps build robust web pages, I became excited and
        wanted to learn more. After completing a few projects for people, I
        discovered that this is how I will serve others. Please let me know how
        I can solve your problem today.
