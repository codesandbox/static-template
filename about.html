          I've worked in the Information Technology field for 10+ years. I
          discovered my passion for technology at a young age when my mother
          bought our first VCR. She was having trouble trying to get it to work
          and didn't understand the features of it. So I played with it until I
          understood how it worked then showed her how to do it. She pointed out
          to me how good I was with this and the rest is history. I take great
          passion in helping others by solving their technical problems which is
          why I wanted to become a front-end web developer.
        </p>

          While working as a IT technician, I would always get asked if I was
          able to build websites. I've always been fascinated with the web and
          always wanted to learn how it works, so one time, I took a course in
          PHP and when I saw how it helps build robust web pages, I became
          excited and wanted to learn more. After completing a few projects for
          people, I discovered that this is how I will serve others. Please let
          me know how I can solve your problem today.
