                <h2 class="underlined">Knowledge OF Rasul</h2>
               <p>â€œPurpose of Knowledge
                   Rasul Allah (sal Allahu alaihi wasallam) said: â€œDo not attain learning in order to express pride before the ulema (scholars), nor by its help quarrel with foolish people, nor through it try to overwhelm meetings, but he who does so, his destination is fire.â€ [Ibn Majah]
                   The purpose of seeking knowledge of the Deen is to be in a better position to seek Allahâ€™s pleasure. All Muslims are required to obtain that knowledge by which they may enter Jannah and escape the Fire. Ignorance is not bliss, for we will be held accountable for that which we could have found out. If we acquire this knowledge to seek worldly gain then it will be rejected by Allah (subhana wa ta'ala). Knowledge that is gained so that we may show it off and appear knowledgeable is a source of destruction.â€
               </p>

                    Ignorance is not bliss, for we will be held accountable for that which we could have found out.
                    If we acquire this knowledge to seek worldly gain then it will be rejected by Allah (subhana wa ta'ala).
                    Knowledge that is gained so that we may show it off and appear knowledgeable is a source of destruction.â€

                </p>

                <h2 class="underlined">Action guided by knowledge</h2>

              <p>Knowledge comes before action, because with knowledge you can recognize the truth from falsehood in the matters of belief, and tell right from wrong in the matters of the sayings, and tell the sunnah from innovations in the matters of worship (ibadat), and tell the valid from the invalid in the matters of dealings, and tell the Halal from Haram in the matters of behavior, and the virtue from foulness in the matters of morals, and the accepted from the unaccepted in the matters of sayings and actions.

                  For this reason, the rightly guided khalifah Amar Bin Abdulaziz (R.A.) said, "Whosoever does a deed without knowledge, he will do bad more than he will do good." This is clear in the lives of some Muslims in the past and in the present- those who do not lack righteousness, sincerity, and zeal, but lack knowledge and understanding for the reality of deen. This is exactly what happened to the group of (Khawarij) kharijites (the oldest religious sect of Islam) who fought Ali Bin Abu Taleb (R.A.) and other companions of the prophet Muhammad (S.A.W.); they the kharijites thought that with their action they will get closer to Allah (S.W.T.). Their unfortunate and disastrous story is well known in the Islamic history. The prophet Muhammad (S.A.W.) said about them and those who are like them in an authentic hadith reported by Imams Bukhari and Muslim, "You the companions belittled your prayers compared to theirs, and your fasting compared to theirs, and your actions compared to theirs, they recite Qurâ€™an but it does not go beyond their throat, they go through deen like the arrow goes through the prey." That is how the messenger described them: "They read Qurâ€™an... but it does not go beyond their throat" which means they do not understand it and do not benefit from it. Thatâ€™s why the messenger described them in another hadith reported by Imams Bukhari and Muslim, "They are young and have weak and narrow minds." They had so little knowledge and understanding, so they did not benefit anything from their reading the book of Allah despite the fact that their recital was abundant, because it was reading without understanding, and sometimes they understood it differently from what Allah meant.</p>

                <h2 class="underlined">Calling to the straight path</h2>
                <p>
                    While all the messengers appointed by Allah were charged by Him with the responsibility to disseminate the revealed guidance with which they were entrusted, their respective nations too, were called upon to share in the fulfilment of Allahâ€™s orders. Allah reminds us in the Holy Quran with (what means): â€œAnd [mention, O Muhammad], when Allah took a covenant from those who were given the Scripture, [saying]: 'You must make it clear [i.e., explain it] to the people and not conceal it.'â€¦â€ [Quran: 3:187]
                    The position of the Muslim Ummah (nation), in this respect, is clear in the Quran, where Allah states (what means): â€œYou are the best nation produced [as an example] for mankind. You enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrongâ€¦â€ [Quran: 3:110]

                    Thus, Allah Almighty has honoured this Muslim Ummah by appointing it to share in the noble cause of its Prophet  sallallaahu  `alayhi  wa  sallam ( may  Allah exalt his mention ) (may Allah exalt his mention) by inviting people to follow the straight path. The Quran further stresses (what means): â€œThe believing men and believing women are allies of one another. They enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrongâ€¦â€ [Quran: 9:71] while: â€œThe hypocrite men and hypocrite women are of one another. They enjoin what is wrong and forbid what is rightâ€¦â€ [Quran: 9:71]

                    Hence, the truth emerges clearly that to enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong constitutes a fundamental difference between a believer and a hypocrite, who pretends to be a believer when he is quite the reverse. Consequently, all members of the Muslim Ummah, men and women alike, are individually responsible to further the cause of Islam with the zeal, determination and sense of sacrifice of the Prophet  sallallaahu  `alayhi  wa  sallam ( may  Allah exalt his mention ) and his companions, may Allah be pleased with them.
