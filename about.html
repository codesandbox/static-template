            <p class="about-description">Founded in 1963, Cultural Vistas is a nonprofit exchange organization promoting global understanding and collaboration among individuals and institutions. We develop international professional experiences that create more informed, skilled, and engaged citizens. Our programs empower people to drive positive change in themselves, their organizations, and society.
              We believe that sustained immersion in a country and language and professional experience, even more than travel or study abroad, promotes confidence and skills that create successful careers and nurture leaders, whether they are community activists or change agents at a global level.
              Every year our 30-plus unique exchange programs reach thousands of individuals and organizations in the United States and more than 130 countries around the world. We invite you to join us as we work together to reach thousands more.
