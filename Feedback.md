For this quarter, I would appreciate it if everything was organized on canvas so I can clearly see the due dates or benchmarks for assignments, the objectives, the recquirements, and the extra featrues we can use. In Web 2, it was difficult going between multiple websites to find all of that information. I know that information can be found on your website, but it helps me stay organized if it is up to date and available on canvas as well.

I appreciate the time in class that's dedicated to collaborating. I haven't taken web online, but I think the breakout rooms work well for collaborating and communicating in teams. In person pair programming in web was really good for troubleshooting, so I am glad that we can still translate that to online classes. I also like how during lecture we can still view coding in real time, like with the master professor pen, or use screen sharing. Also, knowing when specific assignments are due help greatly!

Web 2 online during spring quarter went well, but it was hard to figure out what was due when. If assignments were posted to Canvas with due dates or benchmark dates, it would be really helpful for time management and for clarity. The extra time after lecture/during the end of class was helpful for any questions we may have had that didn't get asked/answered during lecture.
