      <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
      <li>In a large bowl, place the chicken, green seasoning, garlic, Worcestershire sauce, soy sauce, and ketchup, along with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
      <li>Toss to mix and coat the chicken with the seasonings. Set aside and let marinate for at least 1 hour.</li>
      <li>Pour the oil into a large pot and place over medium-high heat. Let it heat until hot but not smoking.</li>
      <li>Make the burnt sugar by sprinkling the cane sugar into the hot oil in an even layer.</li>
      <li>Let the sugar melt until it starts to froth and bubble.</li>
      <li>As soon as the edges of the froth/bubbles start to turn a slight shade darker, immediately add the seasoned chicken. Stir to mix and coat with the burnt sugar. </li>
