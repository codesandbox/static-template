      Wrap roti, often referred to as a roti, is a popular food in the
      Caribbean, and consists of curried or stewed meat and or vegetables folded
      tightly within a dhalpuri or paratha roti. The items placed inside of a
      wrapped roti are commonly called tarkari in Trinidad and Tobago.

      <li>1 1/2 cups Warm Water</li>
      <li>1 tsp. + 1/2 cup Melted Ghee</li>
    </ul>
    <br />

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        For the filling, add water to a pot and bring to a boil over medium
        heat.
      </li>
      <li>Add split peas, turmeric and salt.</li>
      <li>
        Partly cover the pot and allow to cook until tender, approximately 30
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Drain and allow peas to cool and dry completely.</li>
      <li>Once cool and dry, add 1/2 to food processor.</li>
      <li>
        Add chadon beni, pepper and garlic and process into a fine powder. Be
        sure not to allow it to turn into a paste.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove from processor and add remaining split peas, processing into a
        fine powder.
      </li>
      <li>Remove from processor and add to remaining filling.</li>
      <li>Add geera powder to filling and taste for salt. Add If needed.</li>
      <li>Set aside.</li>

      <li>Heat a pot over high heat.</li>
      <li>Add coconut oil/ghee.</li>
      <li>
        Once oil is hot, add filling and cook for 5 minutes, stirring constantly
        to ensure all excess moisture is removed.
      </li>
      <li>Remove from heat and allow to cool.</li>
      <li>
        For the dough, add flour, baking powder, brown sugar and salt to a bowl.
      </li>
      <li>Mix together and make a hole in the middle.</li>
      <li>Add water and knead for 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
      <li>
        Once dough is formed, place in a bowl, rub 1 tsp of ghee all over it,
        cover and allow to rest for 30 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Divide dough into 6 equal pieces (weigh them if necessary).</li>
      <li>
        Using your hand, press each one out into a 4‚Äù disc, ensuring not to
        press out the middle of the dough.
      </li>

      <li>Fill each one with 1/4 cup or more of filling. Do not overfill!</li>
      <li>
        Seal each one by bringing the ends and pinching them together as
        illustrated in the video. I suggest you watch this part several times
        before attempting.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once sealed, dust with flour, place on a floured surface, cover and
        allow to rest for 30 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        On a lightly floured surface, using your rolling pin, roll each roti out
        to 1/8 inch thick, ensuring to turn your roti 90 degrees
        counter-clockwise after each roll.
      </li>
      <li>
        If this is your first attempt, you may want to roll it out to 1/4 inch
        thick as it may burst, causing the filling to spill out.
      </li>
      <li>Heat your tawa over medium heat.</li>
      <li>Once heated, brush with ghee.</li>
      <li>
        Remove excess flour from your roti by gently tossing it from hand to
        hand several times.
      </li>
      <li>Immediately place on tawa and spread your roti into a circle.</li>
      <li>Brush with ghee and flip after 30 seconds.</li>

      <li>
        Once flipped, apply ghee to any dry spots and allow to cook for 30
        seconds.
      </li>
      <li>Flip several times, ensuring the ends are cooked.</li>
      <li>
        Once cooked, fold roti as illustrated in the video, remove from tawa and
        place into an insulated container and allow to sit for 5 to 10 minutes.
      </li>
