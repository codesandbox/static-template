                <h1><strong>Raspberry Pi</strong></h1>
            <small>December, 2020</small>
            <p id="p-1">
                The Raspberry Pi is a low cost, credit-card sized computer that plugs into a computer monitor or TV, and uses a standard keyboard and mouse. We want to see the Raspberry Pi being used by kids all over the world to learn to program and understand how computers work.</br>

<br>In the February of 2015 the Raspberry Pi Foundation launched the Raspberry Pi 2 It was launched with an awesome tag of being 6 times faster. With a 900MHz quad core broad-com processor and a GB of RAM, it has well lived up to the hype. the most popular OS for the raspberry Pi is Raspbian. Which is the official distribution of the Debian Wheezy operating system for the Raspberry Pi Let's see how to install it on the Raspberry Pi 2 though the Raspberry Pi is called one of the cheapest computers, it can't run on its own It needs a couple of input and output devices Here's what you will need to setup your Raspberry Pi.</br>

<br>A Micro-SD card 16GB, class 4 is the minimum requirement but using a higher class card is recommended.</br>



<strong> <br>Requirements</strong></br></strong>

<br>A Keyboard and Mouse I will be using Logitech wireless Keyboard and Mouse But most of the wired keyboard and mouse will work just fine. Next up, you'll need a display and a respective cable All displays will "HDMI or RCA" input work just fine with the Pi but if like me you want to use a monitor with VGA input, you'll have to use a "HDMI to VGA" converter cable. You'll also need a power adapter. 600mA is the minimum requirement but 1A is recommended. Internet connectivity is optional while setting up the pi but is required to get the updates. You can either use a "LAN cable or a USB Wi-Fi" Dongle.</br>


<br><strong>Installation Of OS</strong></br>
If you have all these, lets get the microSD card ready On your PC goto raspberrypi.org/downloads From here, download the latest version of Raspbian It will be a zip file and you will need Balena Etcher a software to unzip the file  head over to google and search for Balena Etcher  Click on the https://www.balena.io/ link and download the exe file Install this when its done downloading you'll need this to write the raspbian image to the SD card When the download is complete open the raspbian image with Balena Etcher and extract the iso file to any location you wish. Wait for it to extract, it may take a couple of minutes. Now, insert the SD card into your PC format it once using the windows format tool To write the image to the SD card open the Balena Etcher Select the correct drive letter for your SD card and select the iso image file from the location you extracted it to. remember to close any Windows Explorer windows and any music player that might be running in the background.</br>

<br><strong>Building Compilation After Installation </strong></br>

The third option is boot settings This lets you choose whether to boot into the desktop environment, scratch or the command line. since most of the work on the command line done through the command line, we will leave it to that the fourth option is internationalization options this lets you change the keyboard layouts and languages I am gonna go with the defaults for now. If you don't know what overclocking means then you should not touch the seventh option. Going into the advanced options, you should enable SSH even if you don't know what it is right now, most of the projects use it and it is a very helpful tool in general since it lets you control all the aspects of your raspberry pi without a dedicated display. SPI and I2C are methods of connecting various devices and modules to your Pi We can leave these options untouched for now. if you have connected external speakers to the 3.5mm jack then you can force the audio through that jack with this option You can navigate to the bottom buttons by using the left or right arrow keys Exit this menu and select 'finish' and then 'yes' to reboot. if you ever wish to change any of these options later on, you can always come back by running the command "sudo raspi-config' in the command line or the terminal after the reboot is complete you will be asked for login The default username is "pi", type that and hit enter The password is "Raspberry" The password won't be visible while typing, this is a security feature in Linux systems You are now successfully running Raspbian!!! to go to the desktop environment type "startx" (without space) and hit enter If you had plugged in a LAN cable then you should be now connected to the net but if you had plugged in a Wi-Fi Dongle, you need to configure your Wi-Fi connection to do that click on "menu" in the upper left hand corner and then on "preferences" and select "WiFi Configuration" In the window that pops up click manage networks and hit scan.

                <h1>IOT - INTERNET OF THINGS</h1>
                <small>December, 2020</small>
                <p>Hey I know-I know that this Article is too long but its neccesary so 
                    coming to the agenda of the session we started by checking out a quick introduction to IOT and will understand dwhy we require IOT after that we'll take a quick overview on how IOT works and the architecture of it as well and lastly we'll check out the applications and the usage of the Internet of Things. 
                    Last but not the least will checkout my final thoughts on the session to start out with let me ask you this did you know that by the time you pretty much read everything when you screen right now by the time you saw the tiny animation there are 4,000 new devices which connected to the Internet just now so all in total there are 50 billion devices that are connected to the Internet worldwide.
                
                <br<strong>Various Aspects Of IOT</strong></br>
            
                <br>The end of the day you can have these parcels and packets sent into that box and then you can later lock it remotely and what not well the one thing you need to know about IOT is that the absolute endless hunt for making things smart everything from smartwatches as I just mentioned to smart shoes to basically anything you can think of so it can be a smart health tracker whatever it is if it is associated with the word smart there is a 70% probability that it includes something to do with the Internet of Technology .</br>

                </br> Now coming to IOT as a carrier well these are among the 4 most important reasons of why you should consider IOT to be your carrier :
                <br>It is among the top 10 jobs in the entirety of this decade it was in the top 10 jobs for the last decade and it has been projected it's gonna remain in a higher spot at this decade as well now coming to business requirements in today's world everyone wants their problems to be solved at the quickest with respect to IOT there is this demand and supply created where the demand is high while supply is less. </br>
                 
                <br>if you jump on the IOT trend you can make a very good carrier out of it and of course we live in the mobile era right so for 80% of our tasks during the entirety of the day we look at our Mobile's for its speed browsing the Internet beat ordering food beat our getting into a meeting .We are the mobile era so we are a generation of mobile users who are basically achieving goals and feats which could have not been done probably 10 years before now anyway 20 years ago this would have just been fiction right .</br>
                 <br>It's is that IOT is a one-stop solution to everything be it be it recycling be green energy beat your health monitoring be it smart cycles be it your working environment being smart beat power saving whatever it is so we can go on and name unlimited number of applications on why IOT should be a very good career path for you guys and of course at the end of the day it is an amazing career path. </br>
                <br> then when we have to talk about how IOT actually works well IOT works on a five main principle components are one it's the hardware hardware consists of all of these sensors the actuators and everything which form the actual device is this the part of the sensing layer which means check out in the architecture and then comes the software then you have to talk about software you will be writing custom code and custom programming concepts.</br>
                
                <br>You'll be helping this hardware talk to the internet and of course if you have to make a software talk to the internet you actually need access to the Internet and this is where there's the protocol layer where you'll be actually making your software and hardware connected to each other.</br>
               <br> We are in the internet era and then when you think about it when you're on the internet you need some security so defining security protocols to ensure that your software's your hardware and in fact the entirety of your IOT device is safe the security protocols are very much important and then of course after all of this is done your device is ready now you need a way to control this to control all of this you can make use of your computer you can make use of your mobile and at the end of the day anything that's connected to the Internet can have access to this. </br>
               <br> Here is where you have your application here is where you'd have your dashboard here is where basically you will have the controlling entity to go on make changes used or IOT device and everything else so if you have to talk about the IOT stack the first thing that we need to talk about is when we say Internet of Things the thing is basically the goal objects so this thing is the entity is the asset .</br>
