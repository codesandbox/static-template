      <h1>Baseball</h1>
      <h3>Origins</h3>
    <p>Baseball is a game where players of the defending team try to out the player who is batting. Both the teams take turns at batting and fielding. Three consecutive outs from each team make an innings, and nine innings make a game. The objective of each team is to win by scoring more runs and try to prevent opponents from scoring runs.</p>
    <p>The first game of baseball ever played took place in June 1846 in Hoboken, New Jersey. In 1869, and the first ever team in professional baseball was the Cincinnati Red Stockings.</p>
    <h3>Favorite Players</h3>
    <p>My favorite Baseball Player would have to be Klayton Kershaw. He is a lefty pitcher for the Dodgers and he is one of my favorite players because he is someone I can really strive to be like. I am a lefty too and a pitcher so getting to watch him is a great experience and seeing the Dodgers win the last World Series in 2020 was great.</p>
    <p>A nother favorite player of mine is Sandy Koufax. Sort of the same reason because he is a lefty pitcher and one of the greatest. Although I never got to see him play I knew he was one of the best lefty pitchers at that time. (and one of if not the best pitcher)</p>
