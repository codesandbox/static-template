          <p>
            World-renowned habits expert James Clear has discovered a simpler
            system for transforming your life. He knows that lasting change
            comes from the compound effect of hundreds of small decisions -
            doing two push-ups a day, waking up five minutes early, or holding a
            single short phone call. He calls them atomic habits.

          <p>
            Earth is 4.5 billion years old. In just a fraction of that time, one
            species among countless others has conquered it: us. In this bold
            and provocative book, Yuval Noah Harari explores who we are, how we
            got here and where we're going.
