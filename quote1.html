        “At dawn, when you have trouble getting out of bed, tell yourself: ‘I
        have to go to work—as a human being. What do I have to complain of, if
        I’m going to do what I was born for—the things I was brought into the
        world to do? Or is this what I was created for? To huddle under the
        blankets and stay warm?
      </p>
      <p>&#8216;—But it’s nicer here…&#8217;</p>
      <p>
        So you were born to feel ‘nice’? Instead of doings things and
        experiencing them? Don’t you see the plants, the birds, the ants and
        spiders and bees going about their individual tasks, putting the world
        in order, as best they can? And you’re not willing to do your job as a
        human being? Why aren’t you running to do what your nature demands?
      </p>
      <p>&#8216;—But we have to sleep sometime…&#8217;</p>
      <p>
        Agreed. But nature set a limit on that—as it did on eating and drinking.
        And you’re over the limit. You’ve had more than enough of that. But not
        of working. There you’re still below your quota. You don’t love yourself
        enough. Or you’d love your nature too, and what it demands of you.
        People who love what they do wear themselves down doing it, they even
        forget to wash or eat.
      </p>
      <p>
        Do you have less respect for your own nature than the engraver does for
        engraving, the dancer for dance, the miser for money or the social
        climber for status? When they’re really possessed by what they do,
        they’d rather stop eating and sleeping than give up practicing their
        arts.”
